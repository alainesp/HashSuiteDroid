/******************************************************************************
** This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite
** version 3.8.4.1.  By combining all the individual C code files into this 
** single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a single translation
** unit.  This allows many compilers to do optimizations that would not be
** possible if the files were compiled separately.  Performance improvements
** of 5% or more are commonly seen when SQLite is compiled as a single
** translation unit.
**
** This file is all you need to compile SQLite.  To use SQLite in other
** programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines
** the programming interface to the SQLite library.  (If you do not have 
** the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy embedded within
** the text of this file.  Search for "Begin file sqlite3.h" to find the start
** of the embedded sqlite3.h header file.) Additional code files may be needed
** if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of programming
** language. The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell is also in a
** separate file. This file contains only code for the core SQLite library.

** these result codes are too coarse-grained.  They do not provide as
** much information about problems as programmers might like.  In an effort to
** address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 and later) include
** support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information
** about errors. The extended result codes are enabled or disabled
** on a per database connection basis using the
** [sqlite3_extended_result_codes()] API.
**
** Some of the available extended result codes are listed here.
** One may expect the number of extended result codes will increase
** over time.  Software that uses extended result codes should expect
** to see new result codes in future releases of SQLite.
**
** The SQLITE_OK result code will never be extended.  It will always
** be exactly zero.

** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
** [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element 
** to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
** may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
** only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
** is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to NULL.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
** A [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
** return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
** recognize.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:

** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]

** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL]
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
** any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
** mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and

/*
** CAPI3REF: Standard File Control Opcodes
**
** These integer constants are opcodes for the xFileControl method
** of the [sqlite3_io_methods] object and for the [sqlite3_file_control()]
** interface.
**
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to write the current state of
** the lock (one of [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE], [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED], [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE])
** into an integer that the pArg argument points to. This capability
** is used during testing and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST
** is defined.
** <ul>
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT] opcode is used by SQLite to give the VFS
** layer a hint of how large the database file will grow to be during the
** current transaction.  This hint is not guaranteed to be accurate but it
** is often close.  The underlying VFS might choose to preallocate database
** file space based on this hint in order to help writes to the database
** file run faster.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE] opcode is used to request that the VFS
** extends and truncates the database file in chunks of a size specified
** by the user. The fourth argument to [sqlite3_file_control()] should 
** point to an integer (type int) containing the new chunk-size to use
** for the nominated database. Allocating database file space in large
** chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and
** improve performance on some systems.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with a particular database
** connection.  See the [sqlite3_file_control()] documentation for
** additional information.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED]]
** No longer in use.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC] opcode is generated internally by SQLite and
** sent to the VFS immediately before the xSync method is invoked on a
** database file descriptor. Or, if the xSync method is not invoked 
** because the user has configured SQLite with 
** [PRAGMA synchronous | PRAGMA synchronous=OFF] it is invoked in place 
** of the xSync method. In most cases, the pointer argument passed with
** this file-control is NULL. However, if the database file is being synced
** as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated
** string containing the transactions master-journal file name. VFSes that 
** do not need this signal should silently ignore this opcode. Applications 
** should not call [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may 
** disrupt the operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.  
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO] opcode is generated internally by SQLite
** and sent to the VFS after a transaction has been committed immediately
** but before the database is unlocked. VFSes that do not need this signal
** should silently ignore this opcode. Applications should not call
** [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may disrupt the 
** operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.  
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY] opcode is used to configure automatic
** retry counts and intervals for certain disk I/O operations for the
** windows [VFS] in order to provide robustness in the presence of
** anti-virus programs.  By default, the windows VFS will retry file read,
** file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay
** of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing
** by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.  This
** opcode allows these two values (10 retries and 25 milliseconds of delay)
** to be adjusted.  The values are changed for all database connections
** within the same process.  The argument is a pointer to an array of two
** integers where the first integer i the new retry count and the second
** integer is the delay.  If either integer is negative, then the setting
** is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written
** into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be
** interrogated.  The zDbName parameter is ignored.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent [WAL | Write Ahead Log] setting.  By default, the auxiliary
** write ahead log and shared memory files used for transaction control
** are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database
** closes.  Setting persistent WAL mode causes those files to persist after
** close.  Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not
** have write permission on the directory containing the database file want
** to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist
** in order for the database to be readable.  The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent
** WAL mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** WAL persistence setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent "powersafe-overwrite" or "PSOW" setting.  The PSOW setting
** determines the [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] bit of the
** xDeviceCharacteristics methods. The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage
** mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** zero-damage mode setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE] opcode is invoked by SQLite after opening
** a write transaction to indicate that, unless it is rolled back for some
** reason, the entire database file will be overwritten by the current 
** transaction. This is used by VACUUM operations.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME] opcode can be used to obtain the names of
** all [VFSes] in the VFS stack.  The names are of all VFS shims and the
** final bottom-level VFS are written into memory obtained from 
** [sqlite3_malloc()] and the result is stored in the char* variable
** that the fourth parameter of [sqlite3_file_control()] points to.
** The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when done.  As with
** all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually
** do anything.  Callers should initialize the char* variable to a NULL
** pointer in case this file-control is not implemented.  This file-control
** is intended for diagnostic use only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]]
** ^Whenever a [PRAGMA] statement is parsed, an [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] 
** file control is sent to the open [sqlite3_file] object corresponding
** to the database file to which the pragma statement refers. ^The argument
** to the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control is an array of
** pointers to strings (char**) in which the second element of the array
** is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the
** pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.  ^The handler for an
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control can optionally make the first element
** of the char** argument point to a string obtained from [sqlite3_mprintf()]
** or the equivalent and that string will become the result of the pragma or
** the error message if the pragma fails. ^If the
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], then normal 
** [PRAGMA] processing continues.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control returns [SQLITE_OK], then the parser assumes that the
** VFS has handled the PRAGMA itself and the parser generates a no-op
** prepared statement.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns
** any result code other than [SQLITE_OK] or [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], that means
** that the VFS encountered an error while handling the [PRAGMA] and the
** compilation of the PRAGMA fails with an error.  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control occurs at the beginning of pragma statement analysis and so
** it is able to override built-in [PRAGMA] statements.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]
** file-control may be invoked by SQLite on the database file handle
** shortly after it is opened in order to provide a custom VFS with access
** to the connections busy-handler callback. The argument is of type (void **)
** - an array of two (void *) values. The first (void *) actually points
** to a function of type (int (*)(void *)). In order to invoke the connections
** busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in
** the array as the only argument. If it returns non-zero, then the operation
** should be retried. If it returns zero, the custom VFS should abandon the
** current operation.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME]]
** ^Application can invoke the [SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME] file-control
** to have SQLite generate a
** temporary filename using the same algorithm that is followed to generate
** temporary filenames for TEMP tables and other internal uses.  The
** argument should be a char** which will be filled with the filename
** written into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  The caller should
** invoke [sqlite3_free()] on the result to avoid a memory leak.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE] file control is used to query or set the
** maximum number of bytes that will be used for memory-mapped I/O.
** The argument is a pointer to a value of type sqlite3_int64 that
** is an advisory maximum number of bytes in the file to memory map.  The
** pointer is overwritten with the old value.  The limit is not changed if
** the value originally pointed to is negative, and so the current limit 
** can be queried by passing in a pointer to a negative number.  This
** file-control is used internally to implement [PRAGMA mmap_size].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE] file control provides advisory information
** to the VFS about what the higher layers of the SQLite stack are doing.
** This file control is used by some VFS activity tracing [shims].
** The argument is a zero-terminated string.  Higher layers in the
** SQLite stack may generate instances of this file control if
** the [SQLITE_USE_FCNTL_TRACE] compile-time option is enabled.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED] file control interprets its argument as a
** pointer to an integer and it writes a boolean into that integer depending
** on whether or not the file has been renamed, moved, or deleted since it
** was first opened.

** at the internal representation of an [sqlite3_mutex].  It only
** deals with pointers to the [sqlite3_mutex] object.
**
** Mutexes are created using [sqlite3_mutex_alloc()].
*/
typedef struct sqlite3_mutex sqlite3_mutex;

/*
** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
**
** An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
** the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
** the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
**
** The value of the iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger in
** future versions of SQLite.  Additional fields may be appended to this
** object when the iVersion value is increased.  Note that the structure
** of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between
** SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not
** modified.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
** implementation should use the pNext pointer.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
** ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
** is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
** from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
** ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
** consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
** 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
** ^SQLite further guarantees that
** the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called. Because of the previous sentence,
** the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
** If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
** must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the 
** xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
** flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. 
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
**
** ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
** </ul>)^
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
**
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
** databases, and subjournals.
**
** ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
** analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
** API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the 
** SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
** be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
** It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened 
** for exclusive access.
**
** ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
** to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
** argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
** the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
** a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
** this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
** element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
** or failure of the xOpen call.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
** ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
** to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
** test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test whether a file is at least readable.   The file can be a
** directory.
**
** ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
** output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
** is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
** interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
** a floating point value.
** ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
** Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in 
** a 24-hour day).  
** ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
** date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or 
** greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
** to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
**
** ^The xSetSystemCall(), xGetSystemCall(), and xNestSystemCall() interfaces
** are not used by the SQLite core.  These optional interfaces are provided
** by some VFSes to facilitate testing of the VFS code. By overriding 
** system calls with functions under its control, a test program can
** simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult
** or impossible to induce.  The set of system calls that can be overridden
** varies from one VFS to another, and from one version of the same VFS to the
** next.  Applications that use these interfaces must be prepared for any
** or all of these interfaces to be NULL or for their behavior to change
** from one release to the next.  Applications must not attempt to access
** any of these methods if the iVersion of the VFS is less than 3.

** CAPI3REF: Initialize The SQLite Library

** deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
** These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and
** shutdown on embedded systems.  Workstation applications using
** SQLite normally do not need to invoke either of these routines.
**
** A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
** the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
** the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
** following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  ^(Only an effective call
** of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
** are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first
** call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize().  ^(Only
** an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization.
** All other valid calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() interface is threadsafe, but sqlite3_shutdown()
** is not.  The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a
** single thread.  All open [database connections] must be closed and all
** other SQLite resources must be deallocated prior to invoking
** sqlite3_shutdown().
**
** Among other things, ^sqlite3_initialize() will invoke
** sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, ^sqlite3_shutdown()
** will invoke sqlite3_os_end().
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
** ^If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
** the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
** as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
** SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
** invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
** calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
** initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
** already.  ^However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
** compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
** are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
** prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
** it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
** directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
** of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
** when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
** default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
** initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
** routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
** performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
** of static resources, initialization of global variables,
** setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
** a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
**
** The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
** or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
** sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
** interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
** sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
** implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
** are built into SQLite when it is compiled for Unix, Windows, or OS/2.
** When [custom builds | built for other platforms]
** (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time
** option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for
** sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().  An application-supplied

** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
** malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
** ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
** xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
** Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite3_malloc()]
** or [sqlite3_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0, 
** that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  For example,
** it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite3_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to
** xInit and xShutdown.
**
** SQLite holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER] mutex when it invokes
** the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
** holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
** it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
** However, if [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
** methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
** serialization.
**
** SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().

** ^If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt

**

** when there is lock contention. ^If SQLite determines that invoking the busy
** handler could result in a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY]

** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that

** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries
**
** This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility.
** Use of this interface is not recommended.
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** ^(As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array names azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter and returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(),
** it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to
** release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
** wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
** reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or

** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions
**
** These routines are work-alikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].  ^Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** ^(The sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().)^  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  ^(Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.)^  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** ^As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  ^The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** ^The sqlite3_vsnprintf() routine is a varargs version of sqlite3_snprintf().
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** ^(The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a nul-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.)^  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
**
** ^(The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
** single quotes).)^  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** ^(The "%z" formatting option works like "%s" but with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string.)^

** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.)^  ^Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
** Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
**
** ^When [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be re-prepared during [sqlite3_step()] due to a 
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite3_step()].
**
** ^Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
** performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite3_step()], unless
** as stated in the previous paragraph, sqlite3_step() invokes
** sqlite3_prepare_v2() to reprepare a statement after a schema change.

** except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control
** over the new database connection.  ^(The flags parameter to

**
** If the 3rd parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is not one of the
** combinations shown above optionally combined with other
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY | SQLITE_OPEN_* bits]
** then the behavior is undefined.
**
** ^If the [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX] flag is set, then the database connection
** opens in the multi-thread [threading mode] as long as the single-thread
** mode has not been set at compile-time or start-time.  ^If the
** [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX] flag is set then the database connection opens
** in the serialized [threading mode] unless single-thread was
** previously selected at compile-time or start-time.
** ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE] flag causes the database connection to be
** eligible to use [shared cache mode], regardless of whether or not shared
** cache is enabled using [sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()].  ^The
** [SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE] flag causes the database connection to not
** participate in [shared cache mode] even if it is enabled.
**
** ^The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system interface that
** the new database connection should use.  ^If the fourth parameter is
** a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs] object is used.
**
** ^If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
** is created for the connection.  ^This in-memory database will vanish when
** the database connection is closed.  Future versions of SQLite might
** make use of additional special filenames that begin with the ":" character.
** It is recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with
** a ":" character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such as
** "./" to avoid ambiguity.
**
** ^If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary
** on-disk database will be created.  ^This private database will be
** automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
**
** [[URI filenames in sqlite3_open()]] <h3>URI Filenames</h3>
**
** ^If [URI filename] interpretation is enabled, and the filename argument
** begins with "file:", then the filename is interpreted as a URI. ^URI
** filename interpretation is enabled if the [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] flag is
** set in the fourth argument to sqlite3_open_v2(), or if it has
** been enabled globally using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_URI] option with the
** [sqlite3_config()] method or by the [SQLITE_USE_URI] compile-time option.
** As of SQLite version 3.7.7, URI filename interpretation is turned off
** by default, but future releases of SQLite might enable URI filename
** interpretation by default.  See "[URI filenames]" for additional
** information.
**
** URI filenames are parsed according to RFC 3986. ^If the URI contains an
** authority, then it must be either an empty string or the string 
** "localhost". ^If the authority is not an empty string or "localhost", an 
** error is returned to the caller. ^The fragment component of a URI, if 
** present, is ignored.
**
** ^SQLite uses the path component of the URI as the name of the disk file
** which contains the database. ^If the path begins with a '/' character, 
** then it is interpreted as an absolute path. ^If the path does not begin 
** with a '/' (meaning that the authority section is omitted from the URI)
** then the path is interpreted as a relative path. 
** ^On windows, the first component of an absolute path 
** is a drive specification (e.g. "C:").
**
** [[core URI query parameters]]
** The query component of a URI may contain parameters that are interpreted
** either by SQLite itself, or by a [VFS | custom VFS implementation].
** SQLite interprets the following three query parameters:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> <b>vfs</b>: ^The "vfs" parameter may be used to specify the name of
**     a VFS object that provides the operating system interface that should
**     be used to access the database file on disk. ^If this option is set to
**     an empty string the default VFS object is used. ^Specifying an unknown
**     VFS is an error. ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the vfs option is
**     present, then the VFS specified by the option takes precedence over
**     the value passed as the fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>mode</b>: ^(The mode parameter may be set to either "ro", "rw",
**     "rwc", or "memory". Attempting to set it to any other value is
**     an error)^. 
**     ^If "ro" is specified, then the database is opened for read-only 
**     access, just as if the [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY] flag had been set in the 
**     third argument to sqlite3_open_v2(). ^If the mode option is set to 
**     "rw", then the database is opened for read-write (but not create) 
**     access, as if SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE (but not SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE) had 
**     been set. ^Value "rwc" is equivalent to setting both 
**     SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE and SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE.  ^If the mode option is
**     set to "memory" then a pure [in-memory database] that never reads
**     or writes from disk is used. ^It is an error to specify a value for
**     the mode parameter that is less restrictive than that specified by
**     the flags passed in the third parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>cache</b>: ^The cache parameter may be set to either "shared" or
**     "private". ^Setting it to "shared" is equivalent to setting the
**     SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE bit in the flags argument passed to
**     sqlite3_open_v2(). ^Setting the cache parameter to "private" is 
**     equivalent to setting the SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE bit.
**     ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the "cache" parameter is present in
**     a URI filename, its value overrides any behavior requested by setting
**     SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE or SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE flag.
** </ul>
**
** ^Specifying an unknown parameter in the query component of a URI is not an
** error.  Future versions of SQLite might understand additional query
** parameters.  See "[query parameters with special meaning to SQLite]" for
** additional information.

**
** If F is the database filename pointer passed into the xOpen() method of 
** a VFS implementation when the flags parameter to xOpen() has one or 
** more of the [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] or [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB] bits set and
** P is the name of the query parameter, then
** sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns the value of the P
** parameter if it exists or a NULL pointer if P does not appear as a 
** query parameter on F.  If P is a query parameter of F
** has no explicit value, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns
** a pointer to an empty string.
**
** The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine assumes that P is a boolean
** parameter and returns true (1) or false (0) according to the value
** of P.  The sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routine returns true (1) if the
** value of query parameter P is one of "yes", "true", or "on" in any
** case or if the value begins with a non-zero number.  The 
** sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) routines returns false (0) if the value of
** query parameter P is one of "no", "false", or "off" in any case or
** if the value begins with a numeric zero.  If P is not a query
** parameter on F or if the value of P is does not match any of the
** above, then sqlite3_uri_boolean(F,P,B) returns (B!=0).
**
** The sqlite3_uri_int64(F,P,D) routine converts the value of P into a
** 64-bit signed integer and returns that integer, or D if P does not
** exist.  If the value of P is something other than an integer, then
** zero is returned.
** 
** If F is a NULL pointer, then sqlite3_uri_parameter(F,P) returns NULL and

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is less than zero, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. ^If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum
** number of  bytes read from zSql.  ^When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be gained by passing an nByte parameter that
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator bytes as this saves SQLite from having to
** make a copy of the input string.
**
** ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** ^*ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  ^If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** ^On success, the sqlite3_prepare() family of routines return [SQLITE_OK];
** otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
** for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** ^In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave differently in three ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** ^If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again. As many as [SQLITE_MAX_SCHEMA_RETRY]
** retries will occur before sqlite3_step() gives up and returns an error.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^When an error occurs, [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed
** [error codes] or [extended error codes].  ^The legacy behavior was that
** [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic [SQLITE_ERROR] result code
** and the application would have to make a second call to [sqlite3_reset()]
** in order to find the underlying cause of the problem. With the "v2" prepare
** interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is returned immediately.
** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^If the specific value bound to [parameter | host parameter] in the 
** WHERE clause might influence the choice of query plan for a statement,
** then the statement will be automatically recompiled, as if there had been 
** a schema change, on the first  [sqlite3_step()] call following any change
** to the [sqlite3_bind_text | bindings] of that [parameter]. 
** ^The specific value of WHERE-clause [parameter] might influence the 
** choice of query plan if the parameter is the left-hand side of a [LIKE]
** or [GLOB] operator or if the parameter is compared to an indexed column
** and the [SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3] compile-time option is enabled.

** interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] or [sqlite3_prepare16()], this function
** must be called one or more times to evaluate the statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of the sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "v2" interface
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interface [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "v2" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** ^In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY],
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** ^With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
** [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
**
** ^[SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  ^If the statement is a [COMMIT]
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within an
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** ^[SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** ^If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** ^[SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** ^With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  ^In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] was required after sqlite3_step() returned anything
** other than [SQLITE_ROW] before any subsequent invocation of
** sqlite3_step().  Failure to reset the prepared statement using 
** [sqlite3_reset()] would result in an [SQLITE_MISUSE] return from
** sqlite3_step().  But after version 3.6.23.1, sqlite3_step() began
** calling [sqlite3_reset()] automatically in this circumstance rather
** than returning [SQLITE_MISUSE].  This is not considered a compatibility
** break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error
** is broken by definition.  The [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET] compile-time option
** can be used to restore the legacy behavior.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()
** API always returns a generic error code, [SQLITE_ERROR], following any
** error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
** [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()] interfaces,
** then the more specific [error codes] are returned directly

** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or

** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
** </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
** sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or
** sqlite3_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite3_column_text() or sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to
** sqlite3_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16()
** with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
**
** ^The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as

**
** ^(If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any

** different preferred text encodings, with different implementations for
** each encoding.
** ^When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite

**
** ^The fourth parameter may optionally be ORed with [SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC]
** to signal that the function will always return the same result given
** the same inputs within a single SQL statement.  Most SQL functions are
** deterministic.  The built-in [random()] SQL function is an example of a
** function that is not deterministic.  The SQLite query planner is able to
** perform additional optimizations on deterministic functions, so use
** of the [SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC] flag is recommended where possible.
**
** ^(The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation of the
** function can gain access to this pointer using [sqlite3_user_data()].)^
**
** ^The sixth, seventh and eighth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL function or
** aggregate. ^A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of the xFunc
** callback only; NULL pointers must be passed as the xStep and xFinal
** parameters. ^An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
** and xFinal and NULL pointer must be passed for xFunc. ^To delete an existing
** SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL pointers for all three function
** callbacks.
**
** ^(If the ninth parameter to sqlite3_create_function_v2() is not NULL,
** then it is destructor for the application data pointer. 
** The destructor is invoked when the function is deleted, either by being
** overloaded or when the database connection closes.)^
** ^The destructor is also invoked if the call to
** sqlite3_create_function_v2() fails.
** ^When the destructor callback of the tenth parameter is invoked, it
** is passed a single argument which is a copy of the application data 
** pointer which was the fifth parameter to sqlite3_create_function_v2().
**
** ^It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  ^SQLite will use
** the implementation that most closely matches the way in which the
** SQL function is used.  ^A function implementation with a non-negative
** nArg parameter is a better match than a function implementation with
** a negative nArg.  ^A function where the preferred text encoding
** matches the database encoding is a better
** match than a function where the encoding is different.  
** ^A function where the encoding difference is between UTF16le and UTF16be
** is a closer match than a function where the encoding difference is
** between UTF8 and UTF16.
**
** ^Built-in functions may be overloaded by new application-defined functions.
**
** ^An application-defined function is permitted to call other

**
** The xFunc (for scalar functions) or xStep (for aggregates) parameters
** to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** define callbacks that implement the SQL functions and aggregates.
** The 3rd parameter to these callbacks is an array of pointers to
** [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  There is one [sqlite3_value] object for
** each parameter to the SQL function.  These routines are used to
** extract values from the [sqlite3_value] objects.
**
** These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
** Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
** object results in undefined behavior.
**
** ^These routines work just like the corresponding [column access functions]
** except that  these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object
** pointer instead of a [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** ^The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF-16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  ^The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF-16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
**

** made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
** such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
** words, if the value is a string that looks like a number)
** then the conversion is performed.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.

** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the [parameter binding] family of

** Refer to the [SQL parameter] documentation for additional information.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from

** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_zeroblob() interfaces set the result of
** the application-defined function to be a BLOB containing all zero
** bytes and N bytes in size, where N is the value of the 2nd parameter.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** ^SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  ^SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF-8. ^SQLite

** byte order.  ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or

** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()

** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or

** ^The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  ^By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  ^A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_toobig() interface causes SQLite to throw an
** error indicating that a string or BLOB is too long to represent.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_nomem() interface causes SQLite to throw an
** error indicating that a memory allocation failed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.

** of the application-defined function to be NULL.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(),
** sqlite3_result_text16le(), and sqlite3_result_text16be() interfaces
** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** ^SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter
** through the first zero character.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is non-negative, then as many bytes (not characters) of the text
** pointed to by the 2nd parameter are taken as the application-defined
** function result.  If the 3rd parameter is non-negative, then it
** must be the byte offset into the string where the NUL terminator would
** appear if the string where NUL terminated.  If any NUL characters occur
** in the string at a byte offset that is less than the value of the 3rd
** parameter, then the resulting string will contain embedded NULs and the
** result of expressions operating on strings with embedded NULs is undefined.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that

** finished using that result.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces or to

** <li> [SQLITE_UTF16], or

** ^The eTextRep argument determines the encoding of strings passed
** to the collating function callback, xCallback.
** ^The [SQLITE_UTF16] and [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] values for eTextRep
** force strings to be UTF16 with native byte order.
** ^The [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] value for eTextRep forces strings to begin
** on an even byte address.
**
** ^The fourth argument, pArg, is an application data pointer that is passed
** through as the first argument to the collating function callback.
**
** ^The fifth argument, xCallback, is a pointer to the collating function.
** ^Multiple collating functions can be registered using the same name but
** with different eTextRep parameters and SQLite will use whichever
** function requires the least amount of data transformation.
** ^If the xCallback argument is NULL then the collating function is
** deleted.  ^When all collating functions having the same name are deleted,
** that collation is no longer usable.
**
** ^The collating function callback is invoked with a copy of the pArg 
** application data pointer and with two strings in the encoding specified
** by the eTextRep argument.  The collating function must return an
** integer that is negative, zero, or positive
** if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second,
** respectively.  A collating function must always return the same answer
** given the same inputs.  If two or more collating functions are registered
** to the same collation name (using different eTextRep values) then all
** must give an equivalent answer when invoked with equivalent strings.
** The collating function must obey the following properties for all
** strings A, B, and C:
**
** <ol>
** <li> If A==B then B==A.
** <li> If A==B and B==C then A==C.
** <li> If A&lt;B THEN B&gt;A.
** <li> If A&lt;B and B&lt;C then A&lt;C.
** </ol>
**
** If a collating function fails any of the above constraints and that
** collating function is  registered and used, then the behavior of SQLite
** is undefined.
**
** ^The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
** with the addition that the xDestroy callback is invoked on pArg when
** the collating function is deleted.
** ^Collating functions are deleted when they are overridden by later

** method of a [virtual table module].  The fields under **Inputs** are the
** inputs to xBestIndex and are read-only.  xBestIndex inserts its
** results into the **Outputs** fields.
**
** ^(The aConstraint[] array records WHERE clause constraints of the form:
**
** <blockquote>column OP expr</blockquote>
**
** where OP is =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;=.)^  ^(The particular operator is

** [SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_EQ | SQLITE_INDEX_CONSTRAINT_ values].)^
** ^(The index of the column is stored in
** aConstraint[].iColumn.)^  ^(aConstraint[].usable is TRUE if the
** expr on the right-hand side can be evaluated (and thus the constraint
** is usable) and false if it cannot.)^
**
** ^The optimizer automatically inverts terms of the form "expr OP column"
** and makes other simplifications to the WHERE clause in an attempt to
** get as many WHERE clause terms into the form shown above as possible.
** ^The aConstraint[] array only reports WHERE clause terms that are
** relevant to the particular virtual table being queried.
**
** ^Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
** ^Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.
**
** The [xBestIndex] method must fill aConstraintUsage[] with information
** about what parameters to pass to xFilter.  ^If argvIndex>0 then
** the right-hand side of the corresponding aConstraint[] is evaluated
** and becomes the argvIndex-th entry in argv.  ^(If aConstraintUsage[].omit
** is true, then the constraint is assumed to be fully handled by the
** virtual table and is not checked again by SQLite.)^
**
** ^The idxNum and idxPtr values are recorded and passed into the

** ^[sqlite3_free()] is used to free idxPtr if and only if
** needToFreeIdxPtr is true.
**
** ^The orderByConsumed means that output from [xFilter]/[xNext] will occur in
** the correct order to satisfy the ORDER BY clause so that no separate
** sorting step is required.
**
** ^The estimatedCost value is an estimate of the cost of a particular

** CAPI3REF: Mutexes
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization. Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations
** of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
** is selected automatically at compile-time.  ^(The following
** implementations are available in the SQLite core:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** </ul>)^
**
** ^The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in
** a single-threaded application.  ^The SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS and
** SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations are appropriate for use on Unix
** and Windows.
**
** ^(If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library. In this case the
** application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite3_config() function
** before calling sqlite3_initialize() or any other public sqlite3_
** function that calls sqlite3_initialize().)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. ^If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  ^SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  ^(The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul>)^
**
** ^The first two constants (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE)
** cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  ^The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  ^SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  ^If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** ^The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() (anything other
** than SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  ^Six static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** ^Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  ^But for the static
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex.  ^SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates.  The dynamic mutexes must not be in
** use when they are deallocated.  Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior.  ^SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex.  ^If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY.  ^The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
** upon successful entry.  ^(Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** In such cases the,
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.)^  ^(If the same thread tries to enter any other
** kind of mutex more than once, the behavior is undefined.
** SQLite will never exhibit
** such behavior in its own use of mutexes.)^
**
** ^(Some systems (for example, Windows 95) do not support the operation
** implemented by sqlite3_mutex_try().  On those systems, sqlite3_mutex_try()
** will always return SQLITE_BUSY.  The SQLite core only ever uses
** sqlite3_mutex_try() as an optimization so this is acceptable behavior.)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_leave() routine exits a mutex that was
** previously entered by the same thread.   ^(The behavior
** is undefined if the mutex is not currently entered by the
** calling thread or is not currently allocated.  SQLite will
** never do either.)^
**
** ^If the argument to sqlite3_mutex_enter(), sqlite3_mutex_try(), or

**
** Usually, the default mutex implementations provided by SQLite are
** sufficient, however the user has the option of substituting a custom
** implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite
** does not provide a suitable implementation. In this case, the user
** creates and populates an instance of this structure to pass
** to sqlite3_config() along with the [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option.
** Additionally, an instance of this structure can be used as an
** output variable when querying the system for the current mutex
** implementation, using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMUTEX] option.
**
** ^The xMutexInit method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system initialization by the sqlite3_initialize() function.
** ^The xMutexInit routine is called by SQLite exactly once for each
** effective call to [sqlite3_initialize()].
**
** ^The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system shutdown by the sqlite3_shutdown() function. The
** implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
** resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
** those obtained by the xMutexInit method.  ^The xMutexEnd()
** interface is invoked exactly once for each call to [sqlite3_shutdown()].
**
** ^(The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,
** xMutexFree, xMutexEnter, xMutexTry, xMutexLeave, xMutexHeld and
** xMutexNotheld) implement the following interfaces (respectively):
**
** <ul>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_alloc()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_free()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_enter()] </li>

**   <li>  [sqlite3_mutex_notheld()] </li>
** </ul>)^
**
** The only difference is that the public sqlite3_XXX functions enumerated
** above silently ignore any invocations that pass a NULL pointer instead
** of a valid mutex handle. The implementations of the methods defined
** by this structure are not required to handle this case, the results
** of passing a NULL pointer instead of a valid mutex handle are undefined
** (i.e. it is acceptable to provide an implementation that segfaults if
** it is passed a NULL pointer).
**
** The xMutexInit() method must be threadsafe.  ^It must be harmless to
** invoke xMutexInit() multiple times within the same process and without
** intervening calls to xMutexEnd().  Second and subsequent calls to
** xMutexInit() must be no-ops.
**
** ^xMutexInit() must not use SQLite memory allocation ([sqlite3_malloc()]
** and its associates).  ^Similarly, xMutexAlloc() must not use SQLite memory
** allocation for a static mutex.  ^However xMutexAlloc() may use SQLite
** memory allocation for a fast or recursive mutex.
**
** ^SQLite will invoke the xMutexEnd() method when [sqlite3_shutdown()] is
** called, but only if the prior call to xMutexInit returned SQLITE_OK.
** If xMutexInit fails in any way, it is expected to clean up after itself

**
** ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
** register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an 
** instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
** In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by 
** SQLite is used for the page cache.
** By implementing a 
** custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
** the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which 
** that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to 
** determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for 
** how long.
**
** The alternative page cache mechanism is an
** extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
** The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
**
** ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an
** internal buffer by SQLite within the call to [sqlite3_config].  Hence
** the application may discard the parameter after the call to
** [sqlite3_config()] returns.)^
**
** [[the xInit() page cache method]]
** ^(The xInit() method is called once for each effective 
** call to [sqlite3_initialize()])^
** (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). ^(The xInit()
** method is passed a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2.pArg value.)^
** The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures 
** required by the custom page cache implementation. 
** ^(If the xInit() method is NULL, then the 
** built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
** page cache.)^
**
** [[the xShutdown() page cache method]]
** ^The xShutdown() method is called by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
** It can be used to clean up 
** any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
** ^The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
**
** ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,
** so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  All other methods must be threadsafe
** in multithreaded applications.
**
** ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().
**
** [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
** SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
** though this is not guaranteed. ^The
** first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
** be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The
** second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage 
** associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
** a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
** extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
** database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
** on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
** ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
** created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
** false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
** does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
** it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
** never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
** ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
** false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.  
** ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
** never contain any unpinned pages.
**
** [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
** ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
** suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
** instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
** the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
** parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
** value; it is advisory only.
**
** [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
** The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
** stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
** 
** [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
** The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to 
** an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
** The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
** pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a 
** single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
** a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
** for each entry in the page cache.
**
** The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
** is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
** to be "pinned".
**
** If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
** implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
** intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
** cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
** parameter to help it determined what action to take:
**
** <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
** <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
** <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
** <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
**                 Otherwise return NULL.
** <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
**                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
** </table>
**
** ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
** will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
** failed.)^  In between the to xFetch() calls, SQLite may
** attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
** pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
**
** [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
** ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
** as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
** then the page must be evicted from the cache.
** ^If the discard parameter is
** zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
** page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
** may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
**
** The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single 
** call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls 
** to xFetch().
**
** [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
** The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
** page passed as the second argument. If the cache
** previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
** discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
** to be pinned.
**
** When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
** existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
** to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
** of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
** they can be safely discarded.
**
** [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]
** ^The xDestroy() method is used to delete a cache allocated by xCreate().
** All resources associated with the specified cache should be freed. ^After
** calling the xDestroy() method, SQLite considers the [sqlite3_pcache*]
** handle invalid, and will not use it with any other sqlite3_pcache_methods2
** functions.
**
** [[the xShrink() page cache method]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xShrink() method when it wants the page cache to
** free up as much of heap memory as possible.  The page cache implementation
** is not obligated to free any memory, but well-behaved implementations should
** do their best.

** <b>sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()</b>

** up and the total number of pages in the source database file.
** The sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount() interfaces
** retrieve these two values, respectively.
**
** ^The values returned by these functions are only updated by
** sqlite3_backup_step(). ^If the source database is modified during a backup
** operation, then the values are not updated to account for any extra
** pages that need to be updated or the size of the source database file
** changing.
**
** <b>Concurrent Usage of Database Handles</b>
**
** ^The source [database connection] may be used by the application for other
** purposes while a backup operation is underway or being initialized.
** ^If SQLite is compiled and configured to support threadsafe database
** connections, then the source database connection may be used concurrently
** from within other threads.
**
** However, the application must guarantee that the destination 
** [database connection] is not passed to any other API (by any thread) after 
** sqlite3_backup_init() is called and before the corresponding call to
** sqlite3_backup_finish().  SQLite does not currently check to see
** if the application incorrectly accesses the destination [database connection]
** and so no error code is reported, but the operations may malfunction
** nevertheless.  Use of the destination database connection while a
** backup is in progress might also also cause a mutex deadlock.
**
** If running in [shared cache mode], the application must
** guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
** is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
** that the application must guarantee that the disk file being 
** backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
** not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** The [sqlite3_backup] object itself is partially threadsafe. Multiple 
** threads may safely make multiple concurrent calls to sqlite3_backup_step().
** However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()
** APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe. If they are invoked at the
** same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is
** possible that they return invalid values.

** CAPI3REF: Unlock Notification
**
** ^When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
** an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
** individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
** [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking. 
** ^This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke 
** when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
** ^This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** ^Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
**
** ^When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. ^After an 
** application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. ^The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite3_step] or [sqlite3_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
**
** ^(If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite3_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite3_unlock_notify().)^
**
** ^If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** ^(There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
** blocked connection. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old.)^ ^If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is canceled. ^The blocked connections 
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite3_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** ^Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite3_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. ^If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. ^If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. ^Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. ^Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite3_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost 
** always appropriate to call sqlite3_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite3_step() call. ^(If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
** SQLITE_LOCKED.)^

** SHARED:    Any number of processes may hold a SHARED lock simultaneously.
** RESERVED:  A single process may hold a RESERVED lock on a file at
**            any time. Other processes may hold and obtain new SHARED locks.
** PENDING:   A single process may hold a PENDING lock on a file at
**            any one time. Existing SHARED locks may persist, but no new
**            SHARED locks may be obtained by other processes.
** EXCLUSIVE: An EXCLUSIVE lock precludes all other locks.
**
** PENDING_LOCK may not be passed directly to sqlite3OsLock(). Instead, a
** process that requests an EXCLUSIVE lock may actually obtain a PENDING
** lock. This can be upgraded to an EXCLUSIVE lock by a subsequent call to
** sqlite3OsLock().

/*
** File Locking Notes:  (Mostly about windows but also some info for Unix)
**
** We cannot use LockFileEx() or UnlockFileEx() on Win95/98/ME because
** those functions are not available.  So we use only LockFile() and
** UnlockFile().
**
** LockFile() prevents not just writing but also reading by other processes.
** A SHARED_LOCK is obtained by locking a single randomly-chosen 
** byte out of a specific range of bytes. The lock byte is obtained at 
** random so two separate readers can probably access the file at the 
** same time, unless they are unlucky and choose the same lock byte.
** An EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is obtained by locking all bytes in the range.
** There can only be one writer.  A RESERVED_LOCK is obtained by locking
** a single byte of the file that is designated as the reserved lock byte.
** A PENDING_LOCK is obtained by locking a designated byte different from
** the RESERVED_LOCK byte.
**
** On WinNT/2K/XP systems, LockFileEx() and UnlockFileEx() are available,
** which means we can use reader/writer locks.  When reader/writer locks
** are used, the lock is placed on the same range of bytes that is used
** for probabilistic locking in Win95/98/ME.  Hence, the locking scheme
** will support two or more Win95 readers or two or more WinNT readers.
** But a single Win95 reader will lock out all WinNT readers and a single
** WinNT reader will lock out all other Win95 readers.
**
** The following #defines specify the range of bytes used for locking.
** SHARED_SIZE is the number of bytes available in the pool from which
** a random byte is selected for a shared lock.  The pool of bytes for
** shared locks begins at SHARED_FIRST. 
**
** The same locking strategy and
** byte ranges are used for Unix.  This leaves open the possiblity of having
** clients on win95, winNT, and unix all talking to the same shared file
** and all locking correctly.  To do so would require that samba (or whatever
** tool is being used for file sharing) implements locks correctly between
** windows and unix.  I'm guessing that isn't likely to happen, but by
** using the same locking range we are at least open to the possibility.
**
** Locking in windows is manditory.  For this reason, we cannot store
** actual data in the bytes used for locking.  The pager never allocates
** the pages involved in locking therefore.  SHARED_SIZE is selected so
** that all locks will fit on a single page even at the minimum page size.
** PENDING_BYTE defines the beginning of the locks.  By default PENDING_BYTE
** is set high so that we don't have to allocate an unused page except
** for very large databases.  But one should test the page skipping logic 
** by setting PENDING_BYTE low and running the entire regression suite.
**
** Changing the value of PENDING_BYTE results in a subtly incompatible
** file format.  Depending on how it is changed, you might not notice
** the incompatibility right away, even running a full regression test.
** The default location of PENDING_BYTE is the first byte past the
** 1GB boundary.

** An object of this type is created for each virtual table present in

**
** If the database schema is shared, then there is one instance of this
** structure for each database connection (sqlite3*) that uses the shared
** schema. This is because each database connection requires its own unique
** instance of the sqlite3_vtab* handle used to access the virtual table 
** implementation. sqlite3_vtab* handles can not be shared between 
** database connections, even when the rest of the in-memory database 
** schema is shared, as the implementation often stores the database
** connection handle passed to it via the xConnect() or xCreate() method
** during initialization internally. This database connection handle may
** then be used by the virtual table implementation to access real tables 
** within the database. So that they appear as part of the callers 
** transaction, these accesses need to be made via the same database 
** connection as that used to execute SQL operations on the virtual table.
**
** All VTable objects that correspond to a single table in a shared
** database schema are initially stored in a linked-list pointed to by
** the Table.pVTable member variable of the corresponding Table object.
** When an sqlite3_prepare() operation is required to access the virtual
** table, it searches the list for the VTable that corresponds to the
** database connection doing the preparing so as to use the correct
** sqlite3_vtab* handle in the compiled query.
**
** When an in-memory Table object is deleted (for example when the
** schema is being reloaded for some reason), the VTable objects are not 
** deleted and the sqlite3_vtab* handles are not xDisconnect()ed 
** immediately. Instead, they are moved from the Table.pVTable list to
** another linked list headed by the sqlite3.pDisconnect member of the
** corresponding sqlite3 structure. They are then deleted/xDisconnected 
** next time a statement is prepared using said sqlite3*. This is done
** to avoid deadlock issues involving multiple sqlite3.mutex mutexes.
** Refer to comments above function sqlite3VtabUnlockList() for an
** explanation as to why it is safe to add an entry to an sqlite3.pDisconnect
** list without holding the corresponding sqlite3.mutex mutex.

** The memory for objects of this type is always allocated by 
** sqlite3DbMalloc(), using the connection handle stored in VTable.db as

** Each node of an expression in the parse tree is an instance
** of this structure.
**
** Expr.op is the opcode. The integer parser token codes are reused
** as opcodes here. For example, the parser defines TK_GE to be an integer
** code representing the ">=" operator. This same integer code is reused
** to represent the greater-than-or-equal-to operator in the expression
** tree.
**
** If the expression is an SQL literal (TK_INTEGER, TK_FLOAT, TK_BLOB, 
** or TK_STRING), then Expr.token contains the text of the SQL literal. If
** the expression is a variable (TK_VARIABLE), then Expr.token contains the 
** variable name. Finally, if the expression is an SQL function (TK_FUNCTION),
** then Expr.token contains the name of the function.
**
** Expr.pRight and Expr.pLeft are the left and right subexpressions of a
** binary operator. Either or both may be NULL.
**
** Expr.x.pList is a list of arguments if the expression is an SQL function,
** a CASE expression or an IN expression of the form "<lhs> IN (<y>, <z>...)".
** Expr.x.pSelect is used if the expression is a sub-select or an expression of
** the form "<lhs> IN (SELECT ...)". If the EP_xIsSelect bit is set in the
** Expr.flags mask, then Expr.x.pSelect is valid. Otherwise, Expr.x.pList is 
** valid.
**
** An expression of the form ID or ID.ID refers to a column in a table.
** For such expressions, Expr.op is set to TK_COLUMN and Expr.iTable is
** the integer cursor number of a VDBE cursor pointing to that table and
** Expr.iColumn is the column number for the specific column.  If the
** expression is used as a result in an aggregate SELECT, then the
** value is also stored in the Expr.iAgg column in the aggregate so that
** it can be accessed after all aggregates are computed.
**
** If the expression is an unbound variable marker (a question mark 
** character '?' in the original SQL) then the Expr.iTable holds the index 
** number for that variable.
**
** If the expression is a subquery then Expr.iColumn holds an integer
** register number containing the result of the subquery.  If the
** subquery gives a constant result, then iTable is -1.  If the subquery
** gives a different answer at different times during statement processing
** then iTable is the address of a subroutine that computes the subquery.
**
** If the Expr is of type OP_Column, and the table it is selecting from
** is a disk table or the "old.*" pseudo-table, then pTab points to the
** corresponding table definition.
**
** ALLOCATION NOTES:
**
** Expr objects can use a lot of memory space in database schema.  To
** help reduce memory requirements, sometimes an Expr object will be
** truncated.  And to reduce the number of memory allocations, sometimes
** two or more Expr objects will be stored in a single memory allocation,
** together with Expr.zToken strings.
**
** If the EP_Reduced and EP_TokenOnly flags are set when
** an Expr object is truncated.  When EP_Reduced is set, then all
** the child Expr objects in the Expr.pLeft and Expr.pRight subtrees
** are contained within the same memory allocation.  Note, however, that
** the subtrees in Expr.x.pList or Expr.x.pSelect are always separately
** allocated, regardless of whether or not EP_Reduced is set.

**

** and the next table on the list.  The parser builds the list this way.
** But sqlite3SrcListShiftJoinType() later shifts the jointypes so that each

** The results of a SELECT can be distributed in several ways, as defined
** by one of the following macros.  The "SRT" prefix means "SELECT Result
** Type".
**
**     SRT_Union       Store results as a key in a temporary index 
**                     identified by pDest->iSDParm.
**
**     SRT_Except      Remove results from the temporary index pDest->iSDParm.
**
**     SRT_Exists      Store a 1 in memory cell pDest->iSDParm if the result
**                     set is not empty.
**
**     SRT_Discard     Throw the results away.  This is used by SELECT
**                     statements within triggers whose only purpose is
**                     the side-effects of functions.
**
** All of the above are free to ignore their ORDER BY clause. Those that
** follow must honor the ORDER BY clause.
**
**     SRT_Output      Generate a row of output (using the OP_ResultRow
**                     opcode) for each row in the result set.
**
**     SRT_Mem         Only valid if the result is a single column.
**                     Store the first column of the first result row
**                     in register pDest->iSDParm then abandon the rest
**                     of the query.  This destination implies "LIMIT 1".
**
**     SRT_Set         The result must be a single column.  Store each
**                     row of result as the key in table pDest->iSDParm. 
**                     Apply the affinity pDest->affSdst before storing
**                     results.  Used to implement "IN (SELECT ...)".
**
**     SRT_EphemTab    Create an temporary table pDest->iSDParm and store
**                     the result there. The cursor is left open after
**                     returning.  This is like SRT_Table except that
**                     this destination uses OP_OpenEphemeral to create
**                     the table first.
**
**     SRT_Coroutine   Generate a co-routine that returns a new row of
**                     results each time it is invoked.  The entry point
**                     of the co-routine is stored in register pDest->iSDParm
**                     and the result row is stored in pDest->nDest registers
**                     starting with pDest->iSdst.
**
**     SRT_Table       Store results in temporary table pDest->iSDParm.
**                     This is like SRT_EphemTab except that the table
**                     is assumed to already be open.
**
**     SRT_DistTable   Store results in a temporary table pDest->iSDParm.
**                     But also use temporary table pDest->iSDParm+1 as
**                     a record of all prior results and ignore any duplicate
**                     rows.  Name means:  "Distinct Table".
**
**     SRT_Queue       Store results in priority queue pDest->iSDParm (really
**                     an index).  Append a sequence number so that all entries
**                     are distinct.
**
**     SRT_DistQueue   Store results in priority queue pDest->iSDParm only if
**                     the same record has never been stored before.  The
**                     index at pDest->iSDParm+1 hold all prior stores.

**   SQLite identifier character      0x40
**

** case. i.e. if the character is a lower-case ASCII character.
** If x is a lower-case ASCII character, then its upper-case equivalent

**
** Standard function tolower() is implemented using the sqlite3UpperToLower[]
** array. tolower() is used more often than toupper() by SQLite.
**
** Bit 0x40 is set if the character non-alphanumeric and can be used in an 
** SQLite identifier.  Identifiers are alphanumerics, "_", "$", and any
** non-ASCII UTF character. Hence the test for whether or not a character is
** part of an identifier is 0x46.
**

** This file contains the C functions that implement date and time

**
** There is only one exported symbol in this file - the function
** sqlite3RegisterDateTimeFunctions() found at the bottom of the file.
** All other code has file scope.
**
** SQLite processes all times and dates as Julian Day numbers.  The
** dates and times are stored as the number of days since noon
** in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the Gregorian
** calendar system. 
**
** 1970-01-01 00:00:00 is JD 2440587.5
** 2000-01-01 00:00:00 is JD 2451544.5
**
** This implemention requires years to be expressed as a 4-digit number
** which means that only dates between 0000-01-01 and 9999-12-31 can
** be represented, even though julian day numbers allow a much wider
** range of dates.
**
** The Gregorian calendar system is used for all dates and times,
** even those that predate the Gregorian calendar.  Historians usually
** use the Julian calendar for dates prior to 1582-10-15 and for some
** dates afterwards, depending on locale.  Beware of this difference.
**
** The conversion algorithms are implemented based on descriptions
** in the following text:

** This file contains low-level memory allocation drivers for when
** SQLite will use the standard C-library malloc/realloc/free interface
** to obtain the memory it needs.
**
** This file contains implementations of the low-level memory allocation
** routines specified in the sqlite3_mem_methods object.  The content of
** this file is only used if SQLITE_SYSTEM_MALLOC is defined.  The
** SQLITE_SYSTEM_MALLOC macro is defined automatically if neither the
** SQLITE_MEMDEBUG nor the SQLITE_WIN32_MALLOC macros are defined.  The
** default configuration is to use memory allocation routines in this
** file.
**
** C-preprocessor macro summary:
**
**    HAVE_MALLOC_USABLE_SIZE     The configure script sets this symbol if
**                                the malloc_usable_size() interface exists
**                                on the target platform.  Or, this symbol
**                                can be set manually, if desired.
**                                If an equivalent interface exists by
**                                a different name, using a separate -D
**                                option to rename it.
**
**    SQLITE_WITHOUT_ZONEMALLOC   Some older macs lack support for the zone
**                                memory allocator.  Set this symbol to enable
**                                building on older macs.
**
**    SQLITE_WITHOUT_MSIZE        Set this symbol to disable the use of
**                                _msize() on windows systems.  This might
**                                be necessary when compiling for Delphi,
**                                for example.

** implementations. Once sqlite3_initialize() has been called,
** the amount of memory available to SQLite is fixed and cannot

** in the build only if SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMSYS3 is defined.

** sqlite3_config().

/*
** A memory allocation (also called a "chunk") consists of two or 
** more blocks where each block is 8 bytes.  The first 8 bytes are 
** a header that is not returned to the user.
**
** A chunk is two or more blocks that is either checked out or
** free.  The first block has format u.hdr.  u.hdr.size4x is 4 times the
** size of the allocation in blocks if the allocation is free.
** The u.hdr.size4x&1 bit is true if the chunk is checked out and
** false if the chunk is on the freelist.  The u.hdr.size4x&2 bit
** is true if the previous chunk is checked out and false if the
** previous chunk is free.  The u.hdr.prevSize field is the size of
** the previous chunk in blocks if the previous chunk is on the
** freelist. If the previous chunk is checked out, then
** u.hdr.prevSize can be part of the data for that chunk and should
** not be read or written.
**
** We often identify a chunk by its index in mem3.aPool[].  When
** this is done, the chunk index refers to the second block of
** the chunk.  In this way, the first chunk has an index of 1.
** A chunk index of 0 means "no such chunk" and is the equivalent
** of a NULL pointer.
**
** The second block of free chunks is of the form u.list.  The
** two fields form a double-linked list of chunks of related sizes.
** Pointers to the head of the list are stored in mem3.aiSmall[] 
** for smaller chunks and mem3.aiHash[] for larger chunks.
**
** The second block of a chunk is user data if the chunk is checked 
** out.  If a chunk is checked out, the user data may extend into
** the u.hdr.prevSize value of the following chunk.

*************************************************************************
** This file contains the C functions that implement a memory
** allocation subsystem for use by SQLite. 
**
** This version of the memory allocation subsystem omits all
** use of malloc(). The application gives SQLite a block of memory
** before calling sqlite3_initialize() from which allocations
** are made and returned by the xMalloc() and xRealloc() 
** implementations. Once sqlite3_initialize() has been called,
** the amount of memory available to SQLite is fixed and cannot
** be changed.
**
** This version of the memory allocation subsystem is included
** in the build only if SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMSYS5 is defined.
**
** This memory allocator uses the following algorithm:
**
**   1.  All memory allocations sizes are rounded up to a power of 2.
**
**   2.  If two adjacent free blocks are the halves of a larger block,
**       then the two blocks are coalesed into the single larger block.
**
**   3.  New memory is allocated from the first available free block.
**
** This algorithm is described in: J. M. Robson. "Bounds for Some Functions
** Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation". Journal of the Association for
** Computing Machinery, Volume 21, Number 8, July 1974, pages 491-499.
** 
** Let n be the size of the largest allocation divided by the minimum
** allocation size (after rounding all sizes up to a power of 2.)  Let M
** be the maximum amount of memory ever outstanding at one time.  Let
** N be the total amount of memory available for allocation.  Robson
** proved that this memory allocator will never breakdown due to 
** fragmentation as long as the following constraint holds:
**
**      N >=  M*(1 + log2(n)/2) - n + 1
**
** The sqlite3_status() logic tracks the maximum values of n and M so
** that an application can, at any time, verify this constraint.

** The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it.  If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM

** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PMEM
** </ul>
**
** The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  Six static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  But for the static 
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has

**
**  *  Bytes in the range of 0x80 through 0xbf which occur as the first

**
** There are actually several different VFS implementations in this file.

** KEEP THE STRUCTURE OF THIS FILE INTACT.  New code should be placed
** in the correct division and should be clearly labeled.
**
** The layout of divisions is as follows:
**
**   *  General-purpose declarations and utility functions.
**   *  Unique file ID logic used by VxWorks.
**   *  Various locking primitive implementations (all except proxy locking):
**      + for Posix Advisory Locks
**      + for no-op locks
**      + for dot-file locks
**      + for flock() locking
**      + for named semaphore locks (VxWorks only)
**      + for AFP filesystem locks (MacOSX only)
**   *  sqlite3_file methods not associated with locking.
**   *  Definitions of sqlite3_io_methods objects for all locking
**      methods plus "finder" functions for each locking method.
**   *  sqlite3_vfs method implementations.
**   *  Locking primitives for the proxy uber-locking-method. (MacOSX only)
**   *  Definitions of sqlite3_vfs objects for all locking methods
**      plus implementations of sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().

/******************************************************************************
*************************** Posix Advisory Locking ****************************
**
** POSIX advisory locks are broken by design.  ANSI STD 1003.1 (1996)
** section 6.5.2.2 lines 483 through 490 specify that when a process
** sets or clears a lock, that operation overrides any prior locks set
** by the same process.  It does not explicitly say so, but this implies
** that it overrides locks set by the same process using a different
** file descriptor.  Consider this test case:
**
**       int fd1 = open("./file1", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
**       int fd2 = open("./file2", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
**
** Suppose ./file1 and ./file2 are really the same file (because
** one is a hard or symbolic link to the other) then if you set
** an exclusive lock on fd1, then try to get an exclusive lock
** on fd2, it works.  I would have expected the second lock to
** fail since there was already a lock on the file due to fd1.
** But not so.  Since both locks came from the same process, the
** second overrides the first, even though they were on different
** file descriptors opened on different file names.
**
** This means that we cannot use POSIX locks to synchronize file access
** among competing threads of the same process.  POSIX locks will work fine
** to synchronize access for threads in separate processes, but not
** threads within the same process.
**
** To work around the problem, SQLite has to manage file locks internally
** on its own.  Whenever a new database is opened, we have to find the
** specific inode of the database file (the inode is determined by the
** st_dev and st_ino fields of the stat structure that fstat() fills in)
** and check for locks already existing on that inode.  When locks are
** created or removed, we have to look at our own internal record of the
** locks to see if another thread has previously set a lock on that same
** inode.
**
** (Aside: The use of inode numbers as unique IDs does not work on VxWorks.
** For VxWorks, we have to use the alternative unique ID system based on
** canonical filename and implemented in the previous division.)
**
** The sqlite3_file structure for POSIX is no longer just an integer file
** descriptor.  It is now a structure that holds the integer file
** descriptor and a pointer to a structure that describes the internal
** locks on the corresponding inode.  There is one locking structure
** per inode, so if the same inode is opened twice, both unixFile structures
** point to the same locking structure.  The locking structure keeps
** a reference count (so we will know when to delete it) and a "cnt"
** field that tells us its internal lock status.  cnt==0 means the
** file is unlocked.  cnt==-1 means the file has an exclusive lock.
** cnt>0 means there are cnt shared locks on the file.
**
** Any attempt to lock or unlock a file first checks the locking
** structure.  The fcntl() system call is only invoked to set a 
** POSIX lock if the internal lock structure transitions between
** a locked and an unlocked state.
**
** But wait:  there are yet more problems with POSIX advisory locks.
**
** If you close a file descriptor that points to a file that has locks,
** all locks on that file that are owned by the current process are
** released.  To work around this problem, each unixInodeInfo object
** maintains a count of the number of pending locks on tha inode.
** When an attempt is made to close an unixFile, if there are
** other unixFile open on the same inode that are holding locks, the call
** to close() the file descriptor is deferred until all of the locks clear.
** The unixInodeInfo structure keeps a list of file descriptors that need to
** be closed and that list is walked (and cleared) when the last lock
** clears.
**
** Yet another problem:  LinuxThreads do not play well with posix locks.
**
** Many older versions of linux use the LinuxThreads library which is
** not posix compliant.  Under LinuxThreads, a lock created by thread
** A cannot be modified or overridden by a different thread B.
** Only thread A can modify the lock.  Locking behavior is correct
** if the appliation uses the newer Native Posix Thread Library (NPTL)
** on linux - with NPTL a lock created by thread A can override locks
** in thread B.  But there is no way to know at compile-time which
** threading library is being used.  So there is no way to know at
** compile-time whether or not thread A can override locks on thread B.
** One has to do a run-time check to discover the behavior of the
** current process.
**
** SQLite used to support LinuxThreads.  But support for LinuxThreads
** was dropped beginning with version 3.7.0.  SQLite will still work with
** LinuxThreads provided that (1) there is no more than one connection 
** per database file in the same process and (2) database connections
** do not move across threads.

  ** confusion with SQLite lock names). The algorithms are complicated
  ** slightly in order to be compatible with windows systems simultaneously
  ** accessing the same database file, in case that is ever required.
  **
  ** Symbols defined in os.h indentify the 'pending byte' and the 'reserved
  ** byte', each single bytes at well known offsets, and the 'shared byte
  ** range', a range of 510 bytes at a well known offset.
  **
  ** To obtain a SHARED lock, a read-lock is obtained on the 'pending
  ** byte'.  If this is successful, a random byte from the 'shared byte
  ** range' is read-locked and the lock on the 'pending byte' released.
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a RESERVED lock after it has a SHARED lock.
  ** A RESERVED lock is implemented by grabbing a write-lock on the
  ** 'reserved byte'. 
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a PENDING lock after it has obtained a
  ** SHARED lock. A PENDING lock is implemented by obtaining a write-lock
  ** on the 'pending byte'. This ensures that no new SHARED locks can be
  ** obtained, but existing SHARED locks are allowed to persist. A process
  ** does not have to obtain a RESERVED lock on the way to a PENDING lock.
  ** This property is used by the algorithm for rolling back a journal file
  ** after a crash.
  **
  ** An EXCLUSIVE lock, obtained after a PENDING lock is held, is
  ** implemented by obtaining a write-lock on the entire 'shared byte
  ** range'. Since all other locks require a read-lock on one of the bytes
  ** within this range, this ensures that no other locks are held on the
  ** database. 
  **
  ** The reason a single byte cannot be used instead of the 'shared byte
  ** range' is that some versions of windows do not support read-locks. By
  ** locking a random byte from a range, concurrent SHARED locks may exist
  ** even if the locking primitive used is always a write-lock.

************************* Begin dot-file Locking ******************************
**
** The dotfile locking implementation uses the existence of separate lock
** files (really a directory) to control access to the database.  This works
** on just about every filesystem imaginable.  But there are serious downsides:
**
**    (1)  There is zero concurrency.  A single reader blocks all other
**         connections from reading or writing the database.
**
**    (2)  An application crash or power loss can leave stale lock files
**         sitting around that need to be cleared manually.
**
** Nevertheless, a dotlock is an appropriate locking mode for use if no
** other locking strategy is available.
**
** Dotfile locking works by creating a subdirectory in the same directory as
** the database and with the same name but with a ".lock" extension added.
** The existence of a lock directory implies an EXCLUSIVE lock.  All other
** lock types (SHARED, RESERVED, PENDING) are mapped into EXCLUSIVE.

** Open a shared-memory area associated with open database file pDbFd.

** as the open database file and has the same name as the open database
** file with the "-shm" suffix added.  For example, if the database file
** is "/home/user1/config.db" then the file that is created and mmapped
** for shared memory will be called "/home/user1/config.db-shm".  
**
** Another approach to is to use files in /dev/shm or /dev/tmp or an
** some other tmpfs mount. But if a file in a different directory
** from the database file is used, then differing access permissions
** or a chroot() might cause two different processes on the same
** database to end up using different files for shared memory - 
** meaning that their memory would not really be shared - resulting
** in database corruption.  Nevertheless, this tmpfs file usage
** can be enabled at compile-time using -DSQLITE_SHM_DIRECTORY="/dev/shm"
** or the equivalent.  The use of the SQLITE_SHM_DIRECTORY compile-time
** option results in an incompatible build of SQLite;  builds of SQLite
** that with differing SQLITE_SHM_DIRECTORY settings attempt to use the
** same database file at the same time, database corruption will likely
** result. The SQLITE_SHM_DIRECTORY compile-time option is considered
** "unsupported" and may go away in a future SQLite release.
**
** When opening a new shared-memory file, if no other instances of that
** file are currently open, in this process or in other processes, then
** the file must be truncated to zero length or have its header cleared.
**
** If the original database file (pDbFd) is using the "unix-excl" VFS
** that means that an exclusive lock is held on the database file and
** that no other processes are able to read or write the database.  In
** that case, we do not really need shared memory.  No shared memory
** file is created.  The shared memory will be simulated with heap memory.

** This division contains definitions of sqlite3_io_methods objects that
** implement various file locking strategies.  It also contains definitions
** of "finder" functions.  A finder-function is used to locate the appropriate
** sqlite3_io_methods object for a particular database file.  The pAppData
** field of the sqlite3_vfs VFS objects are initialized to be pointers to
** the correct finder-function for that VFS.
**
** Most finder functions return a pointer to a fixed sqlite3_io_methods
** object.  The only interesting finder-function is autolockIoFinder, which
** looks at the filesystem type and tries to guess the best locking
** strategy from that.
**
** For finder-funtion F, two objects are created:
**
**    (1) The real finder-function named "FImpt()".
**
**    (2) A constant pointer to this function named just "F".
**
**
** A pointer to the F pointer is used as the pAppData value for VFS
** objects.  We have to do this instead of letting pAppData point
** directly at the finder-function since C90 rules prevent a void*
** from be cast into a function pointer.
**
**
** Each instance of this macro generates two objects:
**
**   *  A constant sqlite3_io_methods object call METHOD that has locking
**      methods CLOSE, LOCK, UNLOCK, CKRESLOCK.
**
**   *  An I/O method finder function called FINDER that returns a pointer

/******************************************************************************
************************** Begin Proxy Locking ********************************
**
** Proxy locking is a "uber-locking-method" in this sense:  It uses the
** other locking methods on secondary lock files.  Proxy locking is a
** meta-layer over top of the primitive locking implemented above.  For
** this reason, the division that implements of proxy locking is deferred
** until late in the file (here) after all of the other I/O methods have
** been defined - so that the primitive locking methods are available
** as services to help with the implementation of proxy locking.
**
****
**
** The default locking schemes in SQLite use byte-range locks on the
** database file to coordinate safe, concurrent access by multiple readers
** and writers [http://sqlite.org/lockingv3.html].  The five file locking
** states (UNLOCKED, PENDING, SHARED, RESERVED, EXCLUSIVE) are implemented
** as POSIX read & write locks over fixed set of locations (via fsctl),
** on AFP and SMB only exclusive byte-range locks are available via fsctl
** with _IOWR('z', 23, struct ByteRangeLockPB2) to track the same 5 states.
** To simulate a F_RDLCK on the shared range, on AFP a randomly selected
** address in the shared range is taken for a SHARED lock, the entire
** shared range is taken for an EXCLUSIVE lock):
**
**      PENDING_BYTE        0x40000000
**      RESERVED_BYTE       0x40000001
**      SHARED_RANGE        0x40000002 -> 0x40000200
**
** This works well on the local file system, but shows a nearly 100x
** slowdown in read performance on AFP because the AFP client disables
** the read cache when byte-range locks are present.  Enabling the read
** cache exposes a cache coherency problem that is present on all OS X
** supported network file systems.  NFS and AFP both observe the
** close-to-open semantics for ensuring cache coherency
** [http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_a8], which does not effectively
** address the requirements for concurrent database access by multiple
** readers and writers
** [http://www.nabble.com/SQLite-on-NFS-cache-coherency-td15655701.html].
**
** To address the performance and cache coherency issues, proxy file locking
** changes the way database access is controlled by limiting access to a
** single host at a time and moving file locks off of the database file
** and onto a proxy file on the local file system.  
**
**
** Using proxy locks
** -----------------
**
** C APIs
**
**  sqlite3_file_control(db, dbname, SQLITE_SET_LOCKPROXYFILE,
**                       <proxy_path> | ":auto:");
**  sqlite3_file_control(db, dbname, SQLITE_GET_LOCKPROXYFILE, &<proxy_path>);
**
**
** SQL pragmas
**
**  PRAGMA [database.]lock_proxy_file=<proxy_path> | :auto:
**  PRAGMA [database.]lock_proxy_file
**
** Specifying ":auto:" means that if there is a conch file with a matching
** host ID in it, the proxy path in the conch file will be used, otherwise
** a proxy path based on the user's temp dir
** (via confstr(_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR,...)) will be used and the
** actual proxy file name is generated from the name and path of the
** database file.  For example:
**
**       For database path "/Users/me/foo.db" 
**       The lock path will be "<tmpdir>/sqliteplocks/_Users_me_foo.db:auto:")
**
** Once a lock proxy is configured for a database connection, it can not
** be removed, however it may be switched to a different proxy path via
** the above APIs (assuming the conch file is not being held by another
** connection or process). 
**
**
** How proxy locking works
** -----------------------
**
** Proxy file locking relies primarily on two new supporting files: 
**
**   *  conch file to limit access to the database file to a single host
**      at a time
**
**   *  proxy file to act as a proxy for the advisory locks normally
**      taken on the database
**
** The conch file - to use a proxy file, sqlite must first "hold the conch"
** by taking an sqlite-style shared lock on the conch file, reading the
** contents and comparing the host's unique host ID (see below) and lock
** proxy path against the values stored in the conch.  The conch file is
** stored in the same directory as the database file and the file name
** is patterned after the database file name as ".<databasename>-conch".
** If the conch file does not exist, or it's contents do not match the
** host ID and/or proxy path, then the lock is escalated to an exclusive
** lock and the conch file contents is updated with the host ID and proxy
** path and the lock is downgraded to a shared lock again.  If the conch
** is held by another process (with a shared lock), the exclusive lock
** will fail and SQLITE_BUSY is returned.
**
** The proxy file - a single-byte file used for all advisory file locks
** normally taken on the database file.   This allows for safe sharing
** of the database file for multiple readers and writers on the same
** host (the conch ensures that they all use the same local lock file).
**
** Requesting the lock proxy does not immediately take the conch, it is
** only taken when the first request to lock database file is made.  
** This matches the semantics of the traditional locking behavior, where
** opening a connection to a database file does not take a lock on it.
** The shared lock and an open file descriptor are maintained until 
** the connection to the database is closed. 
**
** The proxy file and the lock file are never deleted so they only need
** to be created the first time they are used.
**
** Configuration options
** ---------------------
**
**  SQLITE_PREFER_PROXY_LOCKING
**
**       Database files accessed on non-local file systems are
**       automatically configured for proxy locking, lock files are
**       named automatically using the same logic as
**       PRAGMA lock_proxy_file=":auto:"
**    
**  SQLITE_PROXY_DEBUG
**
**       Enables the logging of error messages during host id file
**       retrieval and creation
**
**  LOCKPROXYDIR
**
**       Overrides the default directory used for lock proxy files that
**       are named automatically via the ":auto:" setting
**
**  SQLITE_DEFAULT_PROXYDIR_PERMISSIONS
**
**       Permissions to use when creating a directory for storing the
**       lock proxy files, only used when LOCKPROXYDIR is not set.
**    
**    
** As mentioned above, when compiled with SQLITE_PREFER_PROXY_LOCKING,
** setting the environment variable SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING to 1 will
** force proxy locking to be used for every database file opened, and 0
** will force automatic proxy locking to be disabled for all database
** files (explicity calling the SQLITE_SET_LOCKPROXYFILE pragma or
** sqlite_file_control API is not affected by SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING).

** This file implements an object that represents a fixed-length
** bitmap.  Bits are numbered starting with 1.
**
** A bitmap is used to record which pages of a database file have been
** journalled during a transaction, or which pages have the "dont-write"
** property.  Usually only a few pages are meet either condition.
** So the bitmap is usually sparse and has low cardinality.
** But sometimes (for example when during a DROP of a large table) most
** or all of the pages in a database can get journalled.  In those cases, 
** the bitmap becomes dense with high cardinality.  The algorithm needs 
** to handle both cases well.
**
** The size of the bitmap is fixed when the object is created.
**
** All bits are clear when the bitmap is created.  Individual bits
** may be set or cleared one at a time.
**
** Test operations are about 100 times more common that set operations.
** Clear operations are exceedingly rare.  There are usually between
** 5 and 500 set operations per Bitvec object, though the number of sets can
** sometimes grow into tens of thousands or larger.  The size of the
** Bitvec object is the number of pages in the database file at the
** start of a transaction, and is thus usually less than a few thousand,
** but can be as large as 2 billion for a really big database.

** Implementation of the sqlite3_pcache.xFetch method.

** page.  1 means allocate a new page if space is easily available.  2 
** means to try really hard to allocate a new page.
**
** For a non-purgeable cache (a cache used as the storage for an in-memory
** database) there is really no difference between createFlag 1 and 2.  So
** the calling function (pcache.c) will never have a createFlag of 1 on
** a non-purgeable cache.
**
** There are three different approaches to obtaining space for a page,
** depending on the value of parameter createFlag (which may be 0, 1 or 2).
**
**   1. Regardless of the value of createFlag, the cache is searched for a 
**      copy of the requested page. If one is found, it is returned.
**
**   2. If createFlag==0 and the page is not already in the cache, NULL is
**      returned.
**
**   3. If createFlag is 1, and the page is not already in the cache, then
**      return NULL (do not allocate a new page) if any of the following
**      conditions are true:
**
**       (a) the number of pages pinned by the cache is greater than
**           PCache1.nMax, or
**
**       (b) the number of pages pinned by the cache is greater than
**           the sum of nMax for all purgeable caches, less the sum of 
**           nMin for all other purgeable caches, or
**
**   4. If none of the first three conditions apply and the cache is marked
**      as purgeable, and if one of the following is true:
**
**       (a) The number of pages allocated for the cache is already 
**           PCache1.nMax, or
**
**       (b) The number of pages allocated for all purgeable caches is
**           already equal to or greater than the sum of nMax for all
**           purgeable caches,
**
**       (c) The system is under memory pressure and wants to avoid
**           unnecessary pages cache entry allocations
**
**      then attempt to recycle a page from the LRU list. If it is the right
**      size, return the recycled buffer. Otherwise, free the buffer and
**      proceed to step 5.

** This module implements an object we call a "RowSet".
**
** The RowSet object is a collection of rowids.  Rowids
** are inserted into the RowSet in an arbitrary order.  Inserts
** can be intermixed with tests to see if a given rowid has been
** previously inserted into the RowSet.
**
** After all inserts are finished, it is possible to extract the
** elements of the RowSet in sorted order.  Once this extraction
** process has started, no new elements may be inserted.
**
** Hence, the primitive operations for a RowSet are:
**
**    CREATE
**    INSERT
**    TEST
**    SMALLEST
**    DESTROY
**
** The CREATE and DESTROY primitives are the constructor and destructor,
** obviously.  The INSERT primitive adds a new element to the RowSet.
** TEST checks to see if an element is already in the RowSet.  SMALLEST
** extracts the least value from the RowSet.
**
** The INSERT primitive might allocate additional memory.  Memory is
** allocated in chunks so most INSERTs do no allocation.  There is an 
** upper bound on the size of allocated memory.  No memory is freed
** until DESTROY.
**
** The TEST primitive includes a "batch" number.  The TEST primitive
** will only see elements that were inserted before the last change
** in the batch number.  In other words, if an INSERT occurs between
** two TESTs where the TESTs have the same batch nubmer, then the
** value added by the INSERT will not be visible to the second TEST.
** The initial batch number is zero, so if the very first TEST contains
** a non-zero batch number, it will see all prior INSERTs.
**
** No INSERTs may occurs after a SMALLEST.  An assertion will fail if
** that is attempted.
**
** The cost of an INSERT is roughly constant.  (Sometime new memory
** has to be allocated on an INSERT.)  The cost of a TEST with a new
** batch number is O(NlogN) where N is the number of elements in the RowSet.
** The cost of a TEST using the same batch number is O(logN).  The cost
** of the first SMALLEST is O(NlogN).  Second and subsequent SMALLEST
** primitives are constant time.  The cost of DESTROY is O(N).
**
** There is an added cost of O(N) when switching between TEST and
** SMALLEST primitives.

/******************* NOTES ON THE DESIGN OF THE PAGER ************************
**
** This comment block describes invariants that hold when using a rollback
** journal.  These invariants do not apply for journal_mode=WAL,
** journal_mode=MEMORY, or journal_mode=OFF.
**
** Within this comment block, a page is deemed to have been synced
** automatically as soon as it is written when PRAGMA synchronous=OFF.
** Otherwise, the page is not synced until the xSync method of the VFS
** is called successfully on the file containing the page.
**
** Definition:  A page of the database file is said to be "overwriteable" if
** one or more of the following are true about the page:
** 
**     (a)  The original content of the page as it was at the beginning of
**          the transaction has been written into the rollback journal and
**          synced.
** 
**     (b)  The page was a freelist leaf page at the start of the transaction.
** 
**     (c)  The page number is greater than the largest page that existed in
**          the database file at the start of the transaction.
** 
** (1) A page of the database file is never overwritten unless one of the
**     following are true:
** 
**     (a) The page and all other pages on the same sector are overwriteable.
** 
**     (b) The atomic page write optimization is enabled, and the entire
**         transaction other than the update of the transaction sequence
**         number consists of a single page change.
** 
** (2) The content of a page written into the rollback journal exactly matches
**     both the content in the database when the rollback journal was written
**     and the content in the database at the beginning of the current
**     transaction.
** 
** (3) Writes to the database file are an integer multiple of the page size
**     in length and are aligned on a page boundary.
** 
** (4) Reads from the database file are either aligned on a page boundary and
**     an integer multiple of the page size in length or are taken from the
**     first 100 bytes of the database file.
** 
** (5) All writes to the database file are synced prior to the rollback journal
**     being deleted, truncated, or zeroed.
** 
** (6) If a master journal file is used, then all writes to the database file
**     are synced prior to the master journal being deleted.
** 
** Definition: Two databases (or the same database at two points it time)
** are said to be "logically equivalent" if they give the same answer to
** all queries.  Note in particular the content of freelist leaf
** pages can be changed arbitarily without effecting the logical equivalence
** of the database.
** 
** (7) At any time, if any subset, including the empty set and the total set,
**     of the unsynced changes to a rollback journal are removed and the 
**     journal is rolled back, the resulting database file will be logical
**     equivalent to the database file at the beginning of the transaction.
** 
** (8) When a transaction is rolled back, the xTruncate method of the VFS
**     is called to restore the database file to the same size it was at
**     the beginning of the transaction.  (In some VFSes, the xTruncate
**     method is a no-op, but that does not change the fact the SQLite will
**     invoke it.)
** 
** (9) Whenever the database file is modified, at least one bit in the range
**     of bytes from 24 through 39 inclusive will be changed prior to releasing
**     the EXCLUSIVE lock, thus signaling other connections on the same
**     database to flush their caches.
**
** (10) The pattern of bits in bytes 24 through 39 shall not repeat in less
**      than one billion transactions.
**
** (11) A database file is well-formed at the beginning and at the conclusion
**      of every transaction.
**
** (12) An EXCLUSIVE lock is held on the database file when writing to
**      the database file.
**
** (13) A SHARED lock is held on the database file while reading any
**      content out of the database file.

**   ERROR             -> OPEN                [pager_unlock]
** 
**
**  OPEN:
**
**    The pager starts up in this state. Nothing is guaranteed in this
**    state - the file may or may not be locked and the database size is
**    unknown. The database may not be read or written.
**
**    * No read or write transaction is active.
**    * Any lock, or no lock at all, may be held on the database file.
**    * The dbSize, dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables may not be trusted.
**
**  READER:
**
**    In this state all the requirements for reading the database in 
**    rollback (non-WAL) mode are met. Unless the pager is (or recently
**    was) in exclusive-locking mode, a user-level read transaction is 
**    open. The database size is known in this state.
**
**    A connection running with locking_mode=normal enters this state when
**    it opens a read-transaction on the database and returns to state
**    OPEN after the read-transaction is completed. However a connection
**    running in locking_mode=exclusive (including temp databases) remains in
**    this state even after the read-transaction is closed. The only way
**    a locking_mode=exclusive connection can transition from READER to OPEN
**    is via the ERROR state (see below).
** 
**    * A read transaction may be active (but a write-transaction cannot).
**    * A SHARED or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * The dbSize variable may be trusted (even if a user-level read 
**      transaction is not active). The dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables
**      may not be trusted at this point.
**    * If the database is a WAL database, then the WAL connection is open.
**    * Even if a read-transaction is not open, it is guaranteed that 
**      there is no hot-journal in the file-system.
**
**  WRITER_LOCKED:
**
**    The pager moves to this state from READER when a write-transaction
**    is first opened on the database. In WRITER_LOCKED state, all locks 
**    required to start a write-transaction are held, but no actual 
**    modifications to the cache or database have taken place.
**
**    In rollback mode, a RESERVED or (if the transaction was opened with 
**    BEGIN EXCLUSIVE) EXCLUSIVE lock is obtained on the database file when
**    moving to this state, but the journal file is not written to or opened 
**    to in this state. If the transaction is committed or rolled back while 
**    in WRITER_LOCKED state, all that is required is to unlock the database 
**    file.
**
**    IN WAL mode, WalBeginWriteTransaction() is called to lock the log file.
**    If the connection is running with locking_mode=exclusive, an attempt
**    is made to obtain an EXCLUSIVE lock on the database file.
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * If the connection is open in rollback-mode, a RESERVED or greater 
**      lock is held on the database file.
**    * If the connection is open in WAL-mode, a WAL write transaction
**      is open (i.e. sqlite3WalBeginWriteTransaction() has been successfully
**      called).
**    * The dbSize, dbOrigSize and dbFileSize variables are all valid.
**    * The contents of the pager cache have not been modified.
**    * The journal file may or may not be open.
**    * Nothing (not even the first header) has been written to the journal.
**
**  WRITER_CACHEMOD:
**
**    A pager moves from WRITER_LOCKED state to this state when a page is
**    first modified by the upper layer. In rollback mode the journal file
**    is opened (if it is not already open) and a header written to the
**    start of it. The database file on disk has not been modified.
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * A RESERVED or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * The journal file is open and the first header has been written 
**      to it, but the header has not been synced to disk.
**    * The contents of the page cache have been modified.
**
**  WRITER_DBMOD:
**
**    The pager transitions from WRITER_CACHEMOD into WRITER_DBMOD state
**    when it modifies the contents of the database file. WAL connections
**    never enter this state (since they do not modify the database file,
**    just the log file).
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * An EXCLUSIVE or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * The journal file is open and the first header has been written 
**      and synced to disk.
**    * The contents of the page cache have been modified (and possibly
**      written to disk).
**
**  WRITER_FINISHED:
**
**    It is not possible for a WAL connection to enter this state.
**
**    A rollback-mode pager changes to WRITER_FINISHED state from WRITER_DBMOD
**    state after the entire transaction has been successfully written into the
**    database file. In this state the transaction may be committed simply
**    by finalizing the journal file. Once in WRITER_FINISHED state, it is 
**    not possible to modify the database further. At this point, the upper 
**    layer must either commit or rollback the transaction.
**
**    * A write transaction is active.
**    * An EXCLUSIVE or greater lock is held on the database file.
**    * All writing and syncing of journal and database data has finished.
**      If no error occurred, all that remains is to finalize the journal to
**      commit the transaction. If an error did occur, the caller will need
**      to rollback the transaction. 
**
**  ERROR:
**
**    The ERROR state is entered when an IO or disk-full error (including
**    SQLITE_IOERR_NOMEM) occurs at a point in the code that makes it 
**    difficult to be sure that the in-memory pager state (cache contents, 
**    db size etc.) are consistent with the contents of the file-system.
**
**    Temporary pager files may enter the ERROR state, but in-memory pagers
**    cannot.
**
**    For example, if an IO error occurs while performing a rollback, 
**    the contents of the page-cache may be left in an inconsistent state.
**    At this point it would be dangerous to change back to READER state
**    (as usually happens after a rollback). Any subsequent readers might
**    report database corruption (due to the inconsistent cache), and if
**    they upgrade to writers, they may inadvertently corrupt the database
**    file. To avoid this hazard, the pager switches into the ERROR state
**    instead of READER following such an error.
**
**    Once it has entered the ERROR state, any attempt to use the pager
**    to read or write data returns an error. Eventually, once all 
**    outstanding transactions have been abandoned, the pager is able to
**    transition back to OPEN state, discarding the contents of the 
**    page-cache and any other in-memory state at the same time. Everything
**    is reloaded from disk (and, if necessary, hot-journal rollback peformed)
**    when a read-transaction is next opened on the pager (transitioning
**    the pager into READER state). At that point the system has recovered 
**    from the error.
**
**    Specifically, the pager jumps into the ERROR state if:
**
**      1. An error occurs while attempting a rollback. This happens in
**         function sqlite3PagerRollback().
**
**      2. An error occurs while attempting to finalize a journal file
**         following a commit in function sqlite3PagerCommitPhaseTwo().
**
**      3. An error occurs while attempting to write to the journal or
**         database file in function pagerStress() in order to free up
**         memory.
**
**    In other cases, the error is returned to the b-tree layer. The b-tree
**    layer then attempts a rollback operation. If the error condition 
**    persists, the pager enters the ERROR state via condition (1) above.
**
**    Condition (3) is necessary because it can be triggered by a read-only
**    statement executed within a transaction. In this case, if the error
**    code were simply returned to the user, the b-tree layer would not
**    automatically attempt a rollback, as it assumes that an error in a
**    read-only statement cannot leave the pager in an internally inconsistent 
**    state.
**
**    * The Pager.errCode variable is set to something other than SQLITE_OK.
**    * There are one or more outstanding references to pages (after the
**      last reference is dropped the pager should move back to OPEN state).
**    * The pager is not an in-memory pager.
**    
**
** Notes:
**
**   * A pager is never in WRITER_DBMOD or WRITER_FINISHED state if the
**     connection is open in WAL mode. A WAL connection is always in one
**     of the first four states.
**
**   * Normally, a connection open in exclusive mode is never in PAGER_OPEN
**     state. There are two exceptions: immediately after exclusive-mode has
**     been turned on (and before any read or write transactions are 
**     executed), and when the pager is leaving the "error state".
**
**   * See also: assert_pager_state().

/*
** The Pager.eLock variable is almost always set to one of the 
** following locking-states, according to the lock currently held on
** the database file: NO_LOCK, SHARED_LOCK, RESERVED_LOCK or EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
** This variable is kept up to date as locks are taken and released by
** the pagerLockDb() and pagerUnlockDb() wrappers.
**
** If the VFS xLock() or xUnlock() returns an error other than SQLITE_BUSY
** (i.e. one of the SQLITE_IOERR subtypes), it is not clear whether or not
** the operation was successful. In these circumstances pagerLockDb() and
** pagerUnlockDb() take a conservative approach - eLock is always updated
** when unlocking the file, and only updated when locking the file if the
** VFS call is successful. This way, the Pager.eLock variable may be set
** to a less exclusive (lower) value than the lock that is actually held
** at the system level, but it is never set to a more exclusive value.
**
** This is usually safe. If an xUnlock fails or appears to fail, there may 
** be a few redundant xLock() calls or a lock may be held for longer than
** required, but nothing really goes wrong.
**
** The exception is when the database file is unlocked as the pager moves
** from ERROR to OPEN state. At this point there may be a hot-journal file 
** in the file-system that needs to be rolled back (as part of a OPEN->SHARED
** transition, by the same pager or any other). If the call to xUnlock()
** fails at this point and the pager is left holding an EXCLUSIVE lock, this
** can confuse the call to xCheckReservedLock() call made later as part
** of hot-journal detection.
**
** xCheckReservedLock() is defined as returning true "if there is a RESERVED 
** lock held by this process or any others". So xCheckReservedLock may 
** return true because the caller itself is holding an EXCLUSIVE lock (but
** doesn't know it because of a previous error in xUnlock). If this happens
** a hot-journal may be mistaken for a journal being created by an active
** transaction in another process, causing SQLite to read from the database
** without rolling it back.
**
** To work around this, if a call to xUnlock() fails when unlocking the
** database in the ERROR state, Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK. It
** is only changed back to a real locking state after a successful call
** to xLock(EXCLUSIVE). Also, the code to do the OPEN->SHARED state transition
** omits the check for a hot-journal if Pager.eLock is set to UNKNOWN_LOCK 
** lock. Instead, it assumes a hot-journal exists and obtains an EXCLUSIVE
** lock on the database file before attempting to roll it back. See function
** PagerSharedLock() for more detail.
**
** Pager.eLock may only be set to UNKNOWN_LOCK when the pager is in 
** PAGER_OPEN state.

/*
** A open page cache is an instance of struct Pager. A description of
** some of the more important member variables follows:
**
** eState
**
**   The current 'state' of the pager object. See the comment and state
**   diagram above for a description of the pager state.
**
** eLock
**
**   For a real on-disk database, the current lock held on the database file -
**   NO_LOCK, SHARED_LOCK, RESERVED_LOCK or EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
**
**   For a temporary or in-memory database (neither of which require any
**   locks), this variable is always set to EXCLUSIVE_LOCK. Since such
**   databases always have Pager.exclusiveMode==1, this tricks the pager
**   logic into thinking that it already has all the locks it will ever
**   need (and no reason to release them).
**
**   In some (obscure) circumstances, this variable may also be set to
**   UNKNOWN_LOCK. See the comment above the #define of UNKNOWN_LOCK for
**   details.
**
** changeCountDone
**
**   This boolean variable is used to make sure that the change-counter 
**   (the 4-byte header field at byte offset 24 of the database file) is 
**   not updated more often than necessary. 
**
**   It is set to true when the change-counter field is updated, which 
**   can only happen if an exclusive lock is held on the database file.
**   It is cleared (set to false) whenever an exclusive lock is 
**   relinquished on the database file. Each time a transaction is committed,
**   The changeCountDone flag is inspected. If it is true, the work of
**   updating the change-counter is omitted for the current transaction.
**
**   This mechanism means that when running in exclusive mode, a connection 
**   need only update the change-counter once, for the first transaction
**   committed.
**
** setMaster
**
**   When PagerCommitPhaseOne() is called to commit a transaction, it may
**   (or may not) specify a master-journal name to be written into the 
**   journal file before it is synced to disk.
**
**   Whether or not a journal file contains a master-journal pointer affects 
**   the way in which the journal file is finalized after the transaction is 
**   committed or rolled back when running in "journal_mode=PERSIST" mode.
**   If a journal file does not contain a master-journal pointer, it is
**   finalized by overwriting the first journal header with zeroes. If
**   it does contain a master-journal pointer the journal file is finalized 
**   by truncating it to zero bytes, just as if the connection were 
**   running in "journal_mode=truncate" mode.
**
**   Journal files that contain master journal pointers cannot be finalized
**   simply by overwriting the first journal-header with zeroes, as the
**   master journal pointer could interfere with hot-journal rollback of any
**   subsequently interrupted transaction that reuses the journal file.
**
**   The flag is cleared as soon as the journal file is finalized (either
**   by PagerCommitPhaseTwo or PagerRollback). If an IO error prevents the
**   journal file from being successfully finalized, the setMaster flag
**   is cleared anyway (and the pager will move to ERROR state).
**
** doNotSpill
**
**   This variables control the behavior of cache-spills  (calls made by
**   the pcache module to the pagerStress() routine to write cached data
**   to the file-system in order to free up memory).
**
**   When bits SPILLFLAG_OFF or SPILLFLAG_ROLLBACK of doNotSpill are set,
**   writing to the database from pagerStress() is disabled altogether.
**   The SPILLFLAG_ROLLBACK case is done in a very obscure case that
**   comes up during savepoint rollback that requires the pcache module
**   to allocate a new page to prevent the journal file from being written
**   while it is being traversed by code in pager_playback().  The SPILLFLAG_OFF
**   case is a user preference.
** 
**   If the SPILLFLAG_NOSYNC bit is set, writing to the database from pagerStress()
**   is permitted, but syncing the journal file is not. This flag is set
**   by sqlite3PagerWrite() when the file-system sector-size is larger than
**   the database page-size in order to prevent a journal sync from happening 
**   in between the journalling of two pages on the same sector. 
**
** subjInMemory
**
**   This is a boolean variable. If true, then any required sub-journal
**   is opened as an in-memory journal file. If false, then in-memory
**   sub-journals are only used for in-memory pager files.
**
**   This variable is updated by the upper layer each time a new 
**   write-transaction is opened.
**
** dbSize, dbOrigSize, dbFileSize
**
**   Variable dbSize is set to the number of pages in the database file.
**   It is valid in PAGER_READER and higher states (all states except for
**   OPEN and ERROR). 
**
**   dbSize is set based on the size of the database file, which may be 
**   larger than the size of the database (the value stored at offset
**   28 of the database header by the btree). If the size of the file
**   is not an integer multiple of the page-size, the value stored in
**   dbSize is rounded down (i.e. a 5KB file with 2K page-size has dbSize==2).
**   Except, any file that is greater than 0 bytes in size is considered
**   to have at least one page. (i.e. a 1KB file with 2K page-size leads
**   to dbSize==1).
**
**   During a write-transaction, if pages with page-numbers greater than
**   dbSize are modified in the cache, dbSize is updated accordingly.
**   Similarly, if the database is truncated using PagerTruncateImage(), 
**   dbSize is updated.
**
**   Variables dbOrigSize and dbFileSize are valid in states 
**   PAGER_WRITER_LOCKED and higher. dbOrigSize is a copy of the dbSize
**   variable at the start of the transaction. It is used during rollback,
**   and to determine whether or not pages need to be journalled before
**   being modified.
**
**   Throughout a write-transaction, dbFileSize contains the size of
**   the file on disk in pages. It is set to a copy of dbSize when the
**   write-transaction is first opened, and updated when VFS calls are made
**   to write or truncate the database file on disk. 
**
**   The only reason the dbFileSize variable is required is to suppress 
**   unnecessary calls to xTruncate() after committing a transaction. If, 
**   when a transaction is committed, the dbFileSize variable indicates 
**   that the database file is larger than the database image (Pager.dbSize), 
**   pager_truncate() is called. The pager_truncate() call uses xFilesize()
**   to measure the database file on disk, and then truncates it if required.
**   dbFileSize is not used when rolling back a transaction. In this case
**   pager_truncate() is called unconditionally (which means there may be
**   a call to xFilesize() that is not strictly required). In either case,
**   pager_truncate() may cause the file to become smaller or larger.
**
** dbHintSize
**
**   The dbHintSize variable is used to limit the number of calls made to
**   the VFS xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method. 
**
**   dbHintSize is set to a copy of the dbSize variable when a
**   write-transaction is opened (at the same time as dbFileSize and
**   dbOrigSize). If the xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method is called,
**   dbHintSize is increased to the number of pages that correspond to the
**   size-hint passed to the method call. See pager_write_pagelist() for 
**   details.
**
** errCode
**
**   The Pager.errCode variable is only ever used in PAGER_ERROR state. It
**   is set to zero in all other states. In PAGER_ERROR state, Pager.errCode 
**   is always set to SQLITE_FULL, SQLITE_IOERR or one of the SQLITE_IOERR_XXX 
**   sub-codes.

** database transaction.
** 
** This routine is never called in PAGER_ERROR state. If it is called

** exclusive than a RESERVED lock, it is a no-op.
**
** Otherwise, any active savepoints are released.
**
** If the journal file is open, then it is "finalized". Once a journal 
** file has been finalized it is not possible to use it to roll back a 
** transaction. Nor will it be considered to be a hot-journal by this
** or any other database connection. Exactly how a journal is finalized
** depends on whether or not the pager is running in exclusive mode and
** the current journal-mode (Pager.journalMode value), as follows:
**
**   journalMode==MEMORY
**     Journal file descriptor is simply closed. This destroys an 
**     in-memory journal.
**
**   journalMode==TRUNCATE
**     Journal file is truncated to zero bytes in size.
**
**   journalMode==PERSIST
**     The first 28 bytes of the journal file are zeroed. This invalidates
**     the first journal header in the file, and hence the entire journal
**     file. An invalid journal file cannot be rolled back.
**
**   journalMode==DELETE
**     The journal file is closed and deleted using sqlite3OsDelete().
**
**     If the pager is running in exclusive mode, this method of finalizing
**     the journal file is never used. Instead, if the journalMode is
**     DELETE and the pager is in exclusive mode, the method described under
**     journalMode==PERSIST is used instead.
**
** After the journal is finalized, the pager moves to PAGER_READER state.
** If running in non-exclusive rollback mode, the lock on the file is 
** downgraded to a SHARED_LOCK.
**
** SQLITE_OK is returned if no error occurs. If an error occurs during
** any of the IO operations to finalize the journal file or unlock the
** database then the IO error code is returned to the user. If the 
** operation to finalize the journal file fails, then the code still
** tries to unlock the database file if not in exclusive mode. If the
** unlock operation fails as well, then the first error code related
** to the first error encountered (the journal finalization one) is

**  (2)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the number of valid page records
**       in the journal.  If this value is 0xffffffff, then compute the
**       number of page records from the journal size.
**  (3)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the initial value for the 
**       sanity checksum.
**  (4)  4 byte integer which is the number of pages to truncate the
**       database to during a rollback.
**  (5)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the sector size.  The header
**       is this many bytes in size.
**  (6)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the page size.
**  (7)  zero padding out to the next sector size.
**  (8)  Zero or more pages instances, each as follows:
**        +  4 byte page number.
**        +  pPager->pageSize bytes of data.
**        +  4 byte checksum
**
** When we speak of the journal header, we mean the first 7 items above.
** Each entry in the journal is an instance of the 8th item.
**
** Call the value from the second bullet "nRec".  nRec is the number of
** valid page entries in the journal.  In most cases, you can compute the
** value of nRec from the size of the journal file.  But if a power
** failure occurred while the journal was being written, it could be the
** case that the size of the journal file had already been increased but
** the extra entries had not yet made it safely to disk.  In such a case,
** the value of nRec computed from the file size would be too large.  For
** that reason, we always use the nRec value in the header.
**
** If the nRec value is 0xffffffff it means that nRec should be computed
** from the file size.  This value is used when the user selects the
** no-sync option for the journal.  A power failure could lead to corruption
** in this case.  But for things like temporary table (which will be

**

** Adjust settings of the pager to those specified in the pgFlags parameter.
**
** The "level" in pgFlags & PAGER_SYNCHRONOUS_MASK sets the robustness
** of the database to damage due to OS crashes or power failures by
** changing the number of syncs()s when writing the journals.
** There are three levels:
**
**    OFF       sqlite3OsSync() is never called.  This is the default
**              for temporary and transient files.
**
**    NORMAL    The journal is synced once before writes begin on the
**              database.  This is normally adequate protection, but
**              it is theoretically possible, though very unlikely,
**              that an inopertune power failure could leave the journal
**              in a state which would cause damage to the database
**              when it is rolled back.
**
**    FULL      The journal is synced twice before writes begin on the
**              database (with some additional information - the nRec field
**              of the journal header - being written in between the two
**              syncs).  If we assume that writing a
**              single disk sector is atomic, then this mode provides
**              assurance that the journal will not be corrupted to the
**              point of causing damage to the database during rollback.
**
** The above is for a rollback-journal mode.  For WAL mode, OFF continues
** to mean that no syncs ever occur.  NORMAL means that the WAL is synced
** prior to the start of checkpoint and that the database file is synced
** at the conclusion of the checkpoint if the entire content of the WAL
** was written back into the database.  But no sync operations occur for
** an ordinary commit in NORMAL mode with WAL.  FULL means that the WAL
** file is synced following each commit operation, in addition to the
** syncs associated with NORMAL.
**
** Do not confuse synchronous=FULL with SQLITE_SYNC_FULL.  The
** SQLITE_SYNC_FULL macro means to use the MacOSX-style full-fsync
** using fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC).  SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL means to do an
** ordinary fsync() call.  There is no difference between SQLITE_SYNC_FULL
** and SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL on platforms other than MacOSX.  But the
** synchronous=FULL versus synchronous=NORMAL setting determines when
** the xSync primitive is called and is relevant to all platforms.
**
** Numeric values associated with these states are OFF==1, NORMAL=2,
** and FULL=3.

**      rollback, the contents of the cache are validated by checking
**      the 'change-counter' field of the database file header and
**      discarded if they are found to be invalid.
**
**   2) If the pager is running in exclusive-mode, and there are currently
**      no outstanding references to any pages, and is in the error state,
**      then an attempt is made to clear the error state by discarding
**      the contents of the page cache and rolling back any open journal
**      file.
**
** If everything is successful, SQLITE_OK is returned. If an IO error 
** occurs while locking the database, checking for a hot-journal file or 
** rolling back a journal file, the IO error code is returned.

**
** The extra data appended to a page is always initialized to zeros the

**
** If the database image is smaller than the requested page or if a

** actual disk read occurs. In this case the memory image of the

**
** If noContent is true, then the data returned is zeroed instead of
** being read from the database. Additionally, the bits corresponding
** to pgno in Pager.pInJournal (bitvec of pages already written to the
** journal file) and the PagerSavepoint.pInSavepoint bitvecs of any open
** savepoints are set. This means if the page is made writable at any
** point in the future, using a call to sqlite3PagerWrite(), its contents
** will not be journaled. This saves IO.
**
** The acquisition might fail for several reasons.  In all cases,
** an appropriate error code is returned and *ppPage is set to NULL.
**
** See also sqlite3PagerLookup().  Both this routine and Lookup() attempt
** to find a page in the in-memory cache first.  If the page is not already
** in memory, this routine goes to disk to read it in whereas Lookup()
** just returns 0.  This routine acquires a read-lock the first time it
** has to go to disk, and could also playback an old journal if necessary.
** Since Lookup() never goes to disk, it never has to deal with locks

** This file contains the implementation of a write-ahead log (WAL) used in 
** "journal_mode=WAL" mode.
**
** WRITE-AHEAD LOG (WAL) FILE FORMAT
**
** A WAL file consists of a header followed by zero or more "frames".
** Each frame records the revised content of a single page from the
** database file.  All changes to the database are recorded by writing
** frames into the WAL.  Transactions commit when a frame is written that
** contains a commit marker.  A single WAL can and usually does record 
** multiple transactions.  Periodically, the content of the WAL is
** transferred back into the database file in an operation called a
** "checkpoint".
**
** A single WAL file can be used multiple times.  In other words, the
** WAL can fill up with frames and then be checkpointed and then new
** frames can overwrite the old ones.  A WAL always grows from beginning
** toward the end.  Checksums and counters attached to each frame are
** used to determine which frames within the WAL are valid and which
** are leftovers from prior checkpoints.
**
** The WAL header is 32 bytes in size and consists of the following eight
** big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer values:
**
**     0: Magic number.  0x377f0682 or 0x377f0683
**     4: File format version.  Currently 3007000
**     8: Database page size.  Example: 1024
**    12: Checkpoint sequence number
**    16: Salt-1, random integer incremented with each checkpoint
**    20: Salt-2, a different random integer changing with each ckpt
**    24: Checksum-1 (first part of checksum for first 24 bytes of header).
**    28: Checksum-2 (second part of checksum for first 24 bytes of header).
**
** Immediately following the wal-header are zero or more frames. Each
** frame consists of a 24-byte frame-header followed by a <page-size> bytes
** of page data. The frame-header is six big-endian 32-bit unsigned 
** integer values, as follows:
**
**     0: Page number.
**     4: For commit records, the size of the database image in pages 
**        after the commit. For all other records, zero.
**     8: Salt-1 (copied from the header)
**    12: Salt-2 (copied from the header)
**    16: Checksum-1.
**    20: Checksum-2.
**
** A frame is considered valid if and only if the following conditions are
** true:
**
**    (1) The salt-1 and salt-2 values in the frame-header match
**        salt values in the wal-header
**
**    (2) The checksum values in the final 8 bytes of the frame-header
**        exactly match the checksum computed consecutively on the
**        WAL header and the first 8 bytes and the content of all frames
**        up to and including the current frame.
**
** The checksum is computed using 32-bit big-endian integers if the
** magic number in the first 4 bytes of the WAL is 0x377f0683 and it
** is computed using little-endian if the magic number is 0x377f0682.
** The checksum values are always stored in the frame header in a
** big-endian format regardless of which byte order is used to compute
** the checksum.  The checksum is computed by interpreting the input as
** an even number of unsigned 32-bit integers: x[0] through x[N].  The
** algorithm used for the checksum is as follows:
** 
**   for i from 0 to n-1 step 2:
**     s0 += x[i] + s1;
**     s1 += x[i+1] + s0;
**   endfor
**
** Note that s0 and s1 are both weighted checksums using fibonacci weights
** in reverse order (the largest fibonacci weight occurs on the first element
** of the sequence being summed.)  The s1 value spans all 32-bit 
** terms of the sequence whereas s0 omits the final term.
**
** On a checkpoint, the WAL is first VFS.xSync-ed, then valid content of the
** WAL is transferred into the database, then the database is VFS.xSync-ed.
** The VFS.xSync operations serve as write barriers - all writes launched
** before the xSync must complete before any write that launches after the
** xSync begins.
**
** After each checkpoint, the salt-1 value is incremented and the salt-2
** value is randomized.  This prevents old and new frames in the WAL from
** being considered valid at the same time and being checkpointing together
** following a crash.
**
** READER ALGORITHM
**
** To read a page from the database (call it page number P), a reader
** first checks the WAL to see if it contains page P.  If so, then the
** last valid instance of page P that is a followed by a commit frame
** or is a commit frame itself becomes the value read.  If the WAL
** contains no copies of page P that are valid and which are a commit
** frame or are followed by a commit frame, then page P is read from
** the database file.
**
** To start a read transaction, the reader records the index of the last
** valid frame in the WAL.  The reader uses this recorded "mxFrame" value
** for all subsequent read operations.  New transactions can be appended
** to the WAL, but as long as the reader uses its original mxFrame value
** and ignores the newly appended content, it will see a consistent snapshot
** of the database from a single point in time.  This technique allows
** multiple concurrent readers to view different versions of the database
** content simultaneously.
**
** The reader algorithm in the previous paragraphs works correctly, but 
** because frames for page P can appear anywhere within the WAL, the
** reader has to scan the entire WAL looking for page P frames.  If the
** WAL is large (multiple megabytes is typical) that scan can be slow,
** and read performance suffers.  To overcome this problem, a separate
** data structure called the wal-index is maintained to expedite the
** search for frames of a particular page.
** 
** WAL-INDEX FORMAT
**
** Conceptually, the wal-index is shared memory, though VFS implementations
** might choose to implement the wal-index using a mmapped file.  Because
** the wal-index is shared memory, SQLite does not support journal_mode=WAL 
** on a network filesystem.  All users of the database must be able to
** share memory.
**
** The wal-index is transient.  After a crash, the wal-index can (and should
** be) reconstructed from the original WAL file.  In fact, the VFS is required
** to either truncate or zero the header of the wal-index when the last
** connection to it closes.  Because the wal-index is transient, it can
** use an architecture-specific format; it does not have to be cross-platform.
** Hence, unlike the database and WAL file formats which store all values
** as big endian, the wal-index can store multi-byte values in the native
** byte order of the host computer.
**
** The purpose of the wal-index is to answer this question quickly:  Given
** a page number P and a maximum frame index M, return the index of the 
** last frame in the wal before frame M for page P in the WAL, or return
** NULL if there are no frames for page P in the WAL prior to M.
**
** The wal-index consists of a header region, followed by an one or
** more index blocks.  
**
** The wal-index header contains the total number of frames within the WAL
** in the mxFrame field.
**
** Each index block except for the first contains information on 
** HASHTABLE_NPAGE frames. The first index block contains information on
** HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE frames. The values of HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE and 
** HASHTABLE_NPAGE are selected so that together the wal-index header and
** first index block are the same size as all other index blocks in the
** wal-index.
**
** Each index block contains two sections, a page-mapping that contains the
** database page number associated with each wal frame, and a hash-table 
** that allows readers to query an index block for a specific page number.
** The page-mapping is an array of HASHTABLE_NPAGE (or HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE
** for the first index block) 32-bit page numbers. The first entry in the 
** first index-block contains the database page number corresponding to the
** first frame in the WAL file. The first entry in the second index block
** in the WAL file corresponds to the (HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE+1)th frame in
** the log, and so on.
**
** The last index block in a wal-index usually contains less than the full
** complement of HASHTABLE_NPAGE (or HASHTABLE_NPAGE_ONE) page-numbers,
** depending on the contents of the WAL file. This does not change the
** allocated size of the page-mapping array - the page-mapping array merely
** contains unused entries.
**
** Even without using the hash table, the last frame for page P
** can be found by scanning the page-mapping sections of each index block
** starting with the last index block and moving toward the first, and
** within each index block, starting at the end and moving toward the
** beginning.  The first entry that equals P corresponds to the frame
** holding the content for that page.
**
** The hash table consists of HASHTABLE_NSLOT 16-bit unsigned integers.
** HASHTABLE_NSLOT = 2*HASHTABLE_NPAGE, and there is one entry in the
** hash table for each page number in the mapping section, so the hash 
** table is never more than half full.  The expected number of collisions 
** prior to finding a match is 1.  Each entry of the hash table is an
** 1-based index of an entry in the mapping section of the same
** index block.   Let K be the 1-based index of the largest entry in
** the mapping section.  (For index blocks other than the last, K will
** always be exactly HASHTABLE_NPAGE (4096) and for the last index block
** K will be (mxFrame%HASHTABLE_NPAGE).)  Unused slots of the hash table
** contain a value of 0.
**
** To look for page P in the hash table, first compute a hash iKey on
** P as follows:
**
**      iKey = (P * 383) % HASHTABLE_NSLOT
**
** Then start scanning entries of the hash table, starting with iKey
** (wrapping around to the beginning when the end of the hash table is
** reached) until an unused hash slot is found. Let the first unused slot
** be at index iUnused.  (iUnused might be less than iKey if there was
** wrap-around.) Because the hash table is never more than half full,
** the search is guaranteed to eventually hit an unused entry.  Let 
** iMax be the value between iKey and iUnused, closest to iUnused,
** where aHash[iMax]==P.  If there is no iMax entry (if there exists
** no hash slot such that aHash[i]==p) then page P is not in the
** current index block.  Otherwise the iMax-th mapping entry of the
** current index block corresponds to the last entry that references 
** page P.
**
** A hash search begins with the last index block and moves toward the
** first index block, looking for entries corresponding to page P.  On
** average, only two or three slots in each index block need to be
** examined in order to either find the last entry for page P, or to
** establish that no such entry exists in the block.  Each index block
** holds over 4000 entries.  So two or three index blocks are sufficient
** to cover a typical 10 megabyte WAL file, assuming 1K pages.  8 or 10
** comparisons (on average) suffice to either locate a frame in the
** WAL or to establish that the frame does not exist in the WAL.  This
** is much faster than scanning the entire 10MB WAL.
**
** Note that entries are added in order of increasing K.  Hence, one
** reader might be using some value K0 and a second reader that started
** at a later time (after additional transactions were added to the WAL
** and to the wal-index) might be using a different value K1, where K1>K0.
** Both readers can use the same hash table and mapping section to get
** the correct result.  There may be entries in the hash table with
** K>K0 but to the first reader, those entries will appear to be unused
** slots in the hash table and so the first reader will get an answer as
** if no values greater than K0 had ever been inserted into the hash table
** in the first place - which is what reader one wants.  Meanwhile, the
** second reader using K1 will see additional values that were inserted
** later, which is exactly what reader two wants.  
**
** When a rollback occurs, the value of K is decreased. Hash table entries
** that correspond to frames greater than the new K value are removed
** from the hash table at this point.

** A copy of the following object occurs in the wal-index immediately
** following the second copy of the WalIndexHdr.  This object stores
** information used by checkpoint.
**
** nBackfill is the number of frames in the WAL that have been written
** back into the database. (We call the act of moving content from WAL to
** database "backfilling".)  The nBackfill number is never greater than
** WalIndexHdr.mxFrame.  nBackfill can only be increased by threads
** holding the WAL_CKPT_LOCK lock (which includes a recovery thread).
** However, a WAL_WRITE_LOCK thread can move the value of nBackfill from
** mxFrame back to zero when the WAL is reset.
**
** There is one entry in aReadMark[] for each reader lock.  If a reader
** holds read-lock K, then the value in aReadMark[K] is no greater than
** the mxFrame for that reader.  The value READMARK_NOT_USED (0xffffffff)
** for any aReadMark[] means that entry is unused.  aReadMark[0] is 
** a special case; its value is never used and it exists as a place-holder
** to avoid having to offset aReadMark[] indexs by one.  Readers holding
** WAL_READ_LOCK(0) always ignore the entire WAL and read all content
** directly from the database.
**
** The value of aReadMark[K] may only be changed by a thread that
** is holding an exclusive lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(K).  Thus, the value of
** aReadMark[K] cannot changed while there is a reader is using that mark
** since the reader will be holding a shared lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(K).
**
** The checkpointer may only transfer frames from WAL to database where
** the frame numbers are less than or equal to every aReadMark[] that is
** in use (that is, every aReadMark[j] for which there is a corresponding
** WAL_READ_LOCK(j)).  New readers (usually) pick the aReadMark[] with the
** largest value and will increase an unused aReadMark[] to mxFrame if there
** is not already an aReadMark[] equal to mxFrame.  The exception to the
** previous sentence is when nBackfill equals mxFrame (meaning that everything
** in the WAL has been backfilled into the database) then new readers
** will choose aReadMark[0] which has value 0 and hence such reader will
** get all their all content directly from the database file and ignore 
** the WAL.
**
** Writers normally append new frames to the end of the WAL.  However,
** if nBackfill equals mxFrame (meaning that all WAL content has been
** written back into the database) and if no readers are using the WAL
** (in other words, if there are no WAL_READ_LOCK(i) where i>0) then
** the writer will first "reset" the WAL back to the beginning and start
** writing new content beginning at frame 1.

** access any database page that is modified by a WAL frame up to and
** including frame number aReadMark[pWal->readLock].  The reader will
** use WAL frames up to and including pWal->hdr.mxFrame if pWal->readLock>0
** Or if pWal->readLock==0, then the reader will ignore the WAL
** completely and get all content directly from the database file.
** If the useWal parameter is 1 then the WAL will never be ignored and
** this routine will always set pWal->readLock>0 on success.
** When the read transaction is completed, the caller must release the
** lock on WAL_READ_LOCK(pWal->readLock) and set pWal->readLock to -1.
**
** This routine uses the nBackfill and aReadMark[] fields of the header

** on Ptr(N) and its subpages have values greater than Key(N-1).  And
** so forth.
**
** Finding a particular key requires reading O(log(M)) pages from the 
** disk where M is the number of entries in the tree.
**
** In this implementation, a single file can hold one or more separate 
** BTrees.  Each BTree is identified by the index of its root page.  The
** key and data for any entry are combined to form the "payload".  A
** fixed amount of payload can be carried directly on the database
** page.  If the payload is larger than the preset amount then surplus
** bytes are stored on overflow pages.  The payload for an entry
** and the preceding pointer are combined to form a "Cell".  Each 
** page has a small header which contains the Ptr(N) pointer and other
** information such as the size of key and data.
**
** FORMAT DETAILS
**
** The file is divided into pages.  The first page is called page 1,
** the second is page 2, and so forth.  A page number of zero indicates
** "no such page".  The page size can be any power of 2 between 512 and 65536.
** Each page can be either a btree page, a freelist page, an overflow
** page, or a pointer-map page.
**
** The first page is always a btree page.  The first 100 bytes of the first
** page contain a special header (the "file header") that describes the file.
** The format of the file header is as follows:
**
**   OFFSET   SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      0      16     Header string: "SQLite format 3\000"
**     16       2     Page size in bytes.  (1 means 65536)
**     18       1     File format write version
**     19       1     File format read version
**     20       1     Bytes of unused space at the end of each page
**     21       1     Max embedded payload fraction (must be 64)
**     22       1     Min embedded payload fraction (must be 32)
**     23       1     Min leaf payload fraction (must be 32)
**     24       4     File change counter
**     28       4     Reserved for future use
**     32       4     First freelist page
**     36       4     Number of freelist pages in the file
**     40      60     15 4-byte meta values passed to higher layers
**
**     40       4     Schema cookie
**     44       4     File format of schema layer
**     48       4     Size of page cache
**     52       4     Largest root-page (auto/incr_vacuum)
**     56       4     1=UTF-8 2=UTF16le 3=UTF16be
**     60       4     User version
**     64       4     Incremental vacuum mode
**     68       4     Application-ID
**     72      20     unused
**     92       4     The version-valid-for number
**     96       4     SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER
**
** All of the integer values are big-endian (most significant byte first).
**
** The file change counter is incremented when the database is changed
** This counter allows other processes to know when the file has changed
** and thus when they need to flush their cache.
**
** The max embedded payload fraction is the amount of the total usable
** space in a page that can be consumed by a single cell for standard
** B-tree (non-LEAFDATA) tables.  A value of 255 means 100%.  The default
** is to limit the maximum cell size so that at least 4 cells will fit
** on one page.  Thus the default max embedded payload fraction is 64.
**
** If the payload for a cell is larger than the max payload, then extra
** payload is spilled to overflow pages.  Once an overflow page is allocated,
** as many bytes as possible are moved into the overflow pages without letting
** the cell size drop below the min embedded payload fraction.
**
** The min leaf payload fraction is like the min embedded payload fraction
** except that it applies to leaf nodes in a LEAFDATA tree.  The maximum
** payload fraction for a LEAFDATA tree is always 100% (or 255) and it
** not specified in the header.
**
** Each btree pages is divided into three sections:  The header, the
** cell pointer array, and the cell content area.  Page 1 also has a 100-byte
** file header that occurs before the page header.
**
**      |----------------|
**      | file header    |   100 bytes.  Page 1 only.
**      |----------------|
**      | page header    |   8 bytes for leaves.  12 bytes for interior nodes
**      |----------------|
**      | cell pointer   |   |  2 bytes per cell.  Sorted order.
**      | array          |   |  Grows downward
**      |                |   v
**      |----------------|
**      | unallocated    |
**      | space          |
**      |----------------|   ^  Grows upwards
**      | cell content   |   |  Arbitrary order interspersed with freeblocks.
**      | area           |   |  and free space fragments.
**      |----------------|
**
** The page headers looks like this:
**
**   OFFSET   SIZE     DESCRIPTION
**      0       1      Flags. 1: intkey, 2: zerodata, 4: leafdata, 8: leaf
**      1       2      byte offset to the first freeblock
**      3       2      number of cells on this page
**      5       2      first byte of the cell content area
**      7       1      number of fragmented free bytes
**      8       4      Right child (the Ptr(N) value).  Omitted on leaves.
**
** The flags define the format of this btree page.  The leaf flag means that
** this page has no children.  The zerodata flag means that this page carries
** only keys and no data.  The intkey flag means that the key is a integer
** which is stored in the key size entry of the cell header rather than in
** the payload area.
**
** The cell pointer array begins on the first byte after the page header.
** The cell pointer array contains zero or more 2-byte numbers which are
** offsets from the beginning of the page to the cell content in the cell
** content area.  The cell pointers occur in sorted order.  The system strives
** to keep free space after the last cell pointer so that new cells can
** be easily added without having to defragment the page.
**
** Cell content is stored at the very end of the page and grows toward the
** beginning of the page.
**
** Unused space within the cell content area is collected into a linked list of
** freeblocks.  Each freeblock is at least 4 bytes in size.  The byte offset
** to the first freeblock is given in the header.  Freeblocks occur in
** increasing order.  Because a freeblock must be at least 4 bytes in size,
** any group of 3 or fewer unused bytes in the cell content area cannot
** exist on the freeblock chain.  A group of 3 or fewer free bytes is called
** a fragment.  The total number of bytes in all fragments is recorded.
** in the page header at offset 7.
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      2     Byte offset of the next freeblock
**      2     Bytes in this freeblock
**
** Cells are of variable length.  Cells are stored in the cell content area at
** the end of the page.  Pointers to the cells are in the cell pointer array
** that immediately follows the page header.  Cells is not necessarily
** contiguous or in order, but cell pointers are contiguous and in order.
**
** Cell content makes use of variable length integers.  A variable
** length integer is 1 to 9 bytes where the lower 7 bits of each 
** byte are used.  The integer consists of all bytes that have bit 8 set and
** the first byte with bit 8 clear.  The most significant byte of the integer
** appears first.  A variable-length integer may not be more than 9 bytes long.
** As a special case, all 8 bytes of the 9th byte are used as data.  This
** allows a 64-bit integer to be encoded in 9 bytes.
**
**    0x00                      becomes  0x00000000
**    0x7f                      becomes  0x0000007f
**    0x81 0x00                 becomes  0x00000080
**    0x82 0x00                 becomes  0x00000100
**    0x80 0x7f                 becomes  0x0000007f
**    0x8a 0x91 0xd1 0xac 0x78  becomes  0x12345678
**    0x81 0x81 0x81 0x81 0x01  becomes  0x10204081
**
** Variable length integers are used for rowids and to hold the number of
** bytes of key and data in a btree cell.
**
** The content of a cell looks like this:
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of the left child. Omitted if leaf flag is set.
**     var    Number of bytes of data. Omitted if the zerodata flag is set.
**     var    Number of bytes of key. Or the key itself if intkey flag is set.
**      *     Payload
**      4     First page of the overflow chain.  Omitted if no overflow
**
** Overflow pages form a linked list.  Each page except the last is completely
** filled with data (pagesize - 4 bytes).  The last page can have as little
** as 1 byte of data.
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of next overflow page
**      *     Data
**
** Freelist pages come in two subtypes: trunk pages and leaf pages.  The
** file header points to the first in a linked list of trunk page.  Each trunk
** page points to multiple leaf pages.  The content of a leaf page is
** unspecified.  A trunk page looks like this:
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of next trunk page
**      4     Number of leaf pointers on this page
**      *     zero or more pages numbers of leaves

** Set bit pgno of the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. This is called 
** when a page that previously contained data becomes a free-list leaf 
** page.
**
** The BtShared.pHasContent bitvec exists to work around an obscure
** bug caused by the interaction of two useful IO optimizations surrounding
** free-list leaf pages:
**
**   1) When all data is deleted from a page and the page becomes
**      a free-list leaf page, the page is not written to the database
**      (as free-list leaf pages contain no meaningful data). Sometimes
**      such a page is not even journalled (as it will not be modified,
**      why bother journalling it?).
**
**   2) When a free-list leaf page is reused, its content is not read
**      from the database or written to the journal file (why should it
**      be, if it is not at all meaningful?).
**
** By themselves, these optimizations work fine and provide a handy
** performance boost to bulk delete or insert operations. However, if
** a page is moved to the free-list and then reused within the same
** transaction, a problem comes up. If the page is not journalled when
** it is moved to the free-list and it is also not journalled when it
** is extracted from the free-list and reused, then the original data
** may be lost. In the event of a rollback, it may not be possible
** to restore the database to its original configuration.
**
** The solution is the BtShared.pHasContent bitvec. Whenever a page is 
** moved to become a free-list leaf page, the corresponding bit is
** set in the bitvec. Whenever a leaf page is extracted from the free-list,
** optimization 2 above is omitted if the corresponding bit is already
** set in BtShared.pHasContent. The contents of the bitvec are cleared

** This routine redistributes cells on the iParentIdx'th child of pParent
** (hereafter "the page") and up to 2 siblings so that all pages have about the
** same amount of free space. Usually a single sibling on either side of the
** page are used in the balancing, though both siblings might come from one
** side if the page is the first or last child of its parent. If the page 
** has fewer than 2 siblings (something which can only happen if the page
** is a root page or a child of a root page) then all available siblings
** participate in the balancing.
**
** The number of siblings of the page might be increased or decreased by 
** one or two in an effort to keep pages nearly full but not over full. 
**
** Note that when this routine is called, some of the cells on the page
** might not actually be stored in MemPage.aData[]. This can happen
** if the page is overfull. This routine ensures that all cells allocated
** to the page and its siblings fit into MemPage.aData[] before returning.
**
** In the course of balancing the page and its siblings, cells may be
** inserted into or removed from the parent page (pParent). Doing so
** may cause the parent page to become overfull or underfull. If this
** happens, it is the responsibility of the caller to invoke the correct
** balancing routine to fix this problem (see the balance() routine). 
**
** If this routine fails for any reason, it might leave the database
** in a corrupted state. So if this routine fails, the database should
** be rolled back.
**
** The third argument to this function, aOvflSpace, is a pointer to a
** buffer big enough to hold one page. If while inserting cells into the parent
** page (pParent) the parent page becomes overfull, this buffer is
** used to store the parent's overflow cells. Because this function inserts
** a maximum of four divider cells into the parent page, and the maximum
** size of a cell stored within an internal node is always less than 1/4
** of the page-size, the aOvflSpace[] buffer is guaranteed to be large
** enough for all overflow cells.
**
** If aOvflSpace is set to a null pointer, this function returns 
** SQLITE_NOMEM.

    **   2) The pointer-map entries associated with the first overflow
    **      page in any overflow chains used by new divider cells. These 
    **      have also already been taken care of by the insertCell() code.
    **
    **   3) If the sibling pages are not leaves, then the child pages of
    **      cells stored on the sibling pages may need to be updated.
    **
    **   4) If the sibling pages are not internal intkey nodes, then any
    **      overflow pages used by these cells may need to be updated
    **      (internal intkey nodes never contain pointers to overflow pages).
    **
    **   5) If the sibling pages are not leaves, then the pointer-map
    **      entries for the right-child pages of each sibling may need
    **      to be updated.
    **
    ** Cases 1 and 2 are dealt with above by other code. The next
    ** block deals with cases 3 and 4 and the one after that, case 5. Since
    ** setting a pointer map entry is a relatively expensive operation, this

**
**     * Via the sqlite3_backup_XXX() API function backup_step() and 
**       backup_finish(). Both these functions obtain the source database
**       handle mutex and the mutex associated with the source BtShared 
**       structure, in that order.
**
**     * Via the BackupUpdate() and BackupRestart() functions, which are
**       invoked by the pager layer to report various state changes in
**       the page cache associated with the source database. The mutex
**       associated with the source database BtShared structure will always 
**       be held when either of these functions are invoked.
**
**   The other sqlite3_backup_XXX() API functions, backup_remaining() and
**   backup_pagecount() are not thread-safe functions. If they are called
**   while some other thread is calling backup_step() or backup_finish(),
**   the values returned may be invalid. There is no way for a call to
**   BackupUpdate() or BackupRestart() to interfere with backup_remaining()
**   or backup_pagecount().
**
**   Depending on the SQLite configuration, the database handles and/or
**   the Btree objects may have their own mutexes that require locking.
**   Non-sharable Btrees (in-memory databases for example), do not have
**   associated mutexes.

**
** (later):  It is reported to me that the mixed-endian problem
** on ARM7 is an issue with GCC, not with the ARM7 chip.  It seems
** that early versions of GCC stored the two words of a 64-bit
** float in the wrong order.  And that error has been propagated
** ever since.  The blame is not necessarily with GCC, though.
** GCC might have just copying the problem from a prior compiler.
** I am also told that newer versions of GCC that follow a different
** ABI get the byte order right.
**
** Developers using SQLite on an ARM7 should compile and run their
** application using -DSQLITE_DEBUG=1 at least once.  With DEBUG
** enabled, some asserts below will ensure that the byte order of
** floating point values is correct.
**
** (2007-08-30)  Frank van Vugt has studied this problem closely
** and has send his findings to the SQLite developers.  Frank
** writes that some Linux kernels offer floating point hardware
** emulation that uses only 32-bit mantissas instead of a full 
** 48-bits as required by the IEEE standard.  (This is the
** CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE option.)  On such systems, floating point
** byte swapping becomes very complicated.  To avoid problems,
** the necessary byte swapping is carried out using a 64-bit integer
** rather than a 64-bit float.  Frank assures us that the code here
** works for him.  We, the developers, have no way to independently
** verify this, but Frank seems to know what he is talking about
** so we trust him.

/*****************************************************************************
** What follows is a massive switch statement where each case implements a
** separate instruction in the virtual machine.  If we follow the usual
** indentation conventions, each case should be indented by 6 spaces.  But
** that is a lot of wasted space on the left margin.  So the code within
** the switch statement will break with convention and be flush-left. Another
** big comment (similar to this one) will mark the point in the code where
** we transition back to normal indentation.
**
** The formatting of each case is important.  The makefile for SQLite
** generates two C files "opcodes.h" and "opcodes.c" by scanning this
** file looking for lines that begin with "case OP_".  The opcodes.h files
** will be filled with #defines that give unique integer values to each
** opcode and the opcodes.c file is filled with an array of strings where
** each string is the symbolic name for the corresponding opcode.  If the
** case statement is followed by a comment of the form "/# same as ... #/"
** that comment is used to determine the particular value of the opcode.
**
** Other keywords in the comment that follows each case are used to
** construct the OPFLG_INITIALIZER value that initializes opcodeProperty[].
** Keywords include: in1, in2, in3, out2_prerelease, out2, out3.  See
** the mkopcodeh.awk script for additional information.
**
** Documentation about VDBE opcodes is generated by scanning this file
** for lines of that contain "Opcode:".  That line and all subsequent
** comment lines are used in the generation of the opcode.html documentation
** file.
**
** SUMMARY:
**
**     Formatting is important to scripts that scan this file.
**     Do not deviate from the formatting style currently in use.

** bit is clear then fall through if either operand is NULL.
**
** The SQLITE_AFF_MASK portion of P5 must be an affinity character -
** SQLITE_AFF_TEXT, SQLITE_AFF_INTEGER, and so forth. An attempt is made 
** to coerce both inputs according to this affinity before the
** comparison is made. If the SQLITE_AFF_MASK is 0x00, then numeric
** affinity is used. Note that the affinity conversions are stored
** back into the input registers P1 and P3.  So this opcode can cause
** persistent changes to registers P1 and P3.
**
** Once any conversions have taken place, and neither value is NULL, 
** the values are compared. If both values are blobs then memcmp() is
** used to determine the results of the comparison.  If both values
** are text, then the appropriate collating function specified in
** P4 is  used to do the comparison.  If P4 is not specified then
** memcmp() is used to compare text string.  If both values are
** numeric, then a numeric comparison is used. If the two values
** are of different types, then numbers are considered less than
** strings and strings are considered less than blobs.
**
** If the SQLITE_STOREP2 bit of P5 is set, then do not jump.  Instead,
** store a boolean result (either 0, or 1, or NULL) in register P2.
**
** If the SQLITE_NULLEQ bit is set in P5, then NULL values are considered

** created if it doesn't already exist or the data for an existing
** entry is overwritten.  The data is the value MEM_Blob stored in register
** number P2. The key is stored in register P3. The key must
** be a MEM_Int.
**
** If the OPFLAG_NCHANGE flag of P5 is set, then the row change count is
** incremented (otherwise not).  If the OPFLAG_LASTROWID flag of P5 is set,
** then rowid is stored for subsequent return by the
** sqlite3_last_insert_rowid() function (otherwise it is unmodified).
**
** If the OPFLAG_USESEEKRESULT flag of P5 is set and if the result of
** the last seek operation (OP_NotExists) was a success, then this
** operation will not attempt to find the appropriate row before doing
** the insert but will instead overwrite the row that the cursor is
** currently pointing to.  Presumably, the prior OP_NotExists opcode
** has already positioned the cursor correctly.  This is an optimization
** that boosts performance by avoiding redundant seeks.
**
** If the OPFLAG_ISUPDATE flag is set, then this opcode is part of an
** UPDATE operation.  Otherwise (if the flag is clear) then this opcode
** is part of an INSERT operation.  The difference is only important to
** the update hook.
**
** Parameter P4 may point to a string containing the table-name, or
** may be NULL. If it is not NULL, then the update-hook 
** (sqlite3.xUpdateCallback) is invoked following a successful insert.
**
** (WARNING/TODO: If P1 is a pseudo-cursor and P2 is dynamically
** allocated, then ownership of P2 is transferred to the pseudo-cursor
** and register P2 becomes ephemeral.  If the cursor is changed, the
** value of register P2 will then change.  Make sure this does not
** cause any problems.)

/*
** NOTES ON DATA STRUCTURE USED FOR N-WAY MERGES:
**
** As keys are added to the sorter, they are written to disk in a series
** of sorted packed-memory-arrays (PMAs). The size of each PMA is roughly
** the same as the cache-size allowed for temporary databases. In order
** to allow the caller to extract keys from the sorter in sorted order,
** all PMAs currently stored on disk must be merged together. This comment
** describes the data structure used to do so. The structure supports 
** merging any number of arrays in a single pass with no redundant comparison 
** operations.
**
** The aIter[] array contains an iterator for each of the PMAs being merged.
** An aIter[] iterator either points to a valid key or else is at EOF. For 
** the purposes of the paragraphs below, we assume that the array is actually 
** N elements in size, where N is the smallest power of 2 greater to or equal 
** to the number of iterators being merged. The extra aIter[] elements are 
** treated as if they are empty (always at EOF).
**
** The aTree[] array is also N elements in size. The value of N is stored in
** the VdbeSorter.nTree variable.
**
** The final (N/2) elements of aTree[] contain the results of comparing
** pairs of iterator keys together. Element i contains the result of 
** comparing aIter[2*i-N] and aIter[2*i-N+1]. Whichever key is smaller, the
** aTree element is set to the index of it. 
**
** For the purposes of this comparison, EOF is considered greater than any
** other key value. If the keys are equal (only possible with two EOF
** values), it doesn't matter which index is stored.
**
** The (N/4) elements of aTree[] that precede the final (N/2) described 
** above contains the index of the smallest of each block of 4 iterators.
** And so on. So that aTree[1] contains the index of the iterator that 
** currently points to the smallest key value. aTree[0] is unused.
**
** Example:
**
**     aIter[0] -> Banana
**     aIter[1] -> Feijoa
**     aIter[2] -> Elderberry
**     aIter[3] -> Currant
**     aIter[4] -> Grapefruit
**     aIter[5] -> Apple
**     aIter[6] -> Durian
**     aIter[7] -> EOF
**
**     aTree[] = { X, 5   0, 5    0, 3, 5, 6 }
**
** The current element is "Apple" (the value of the key indicated by 
** iterator 5). When the Next() operation is invoked, iterator 5 will
** be advanced to the next key in its segment. Say the next key is
** "Eggplant":
**
**     aIter[5] -> Eggplant
**
** The contents of aTree[] are updated first by comparing the new iterator
** 5 key to the current key of iterator 4 (still "Grapefruit"). The iterator
** 5 value is still smaller, so aTree[6] is set to 5. And so on up the tree.
** The value of iterator 6 - "Durian" - is now smaller than that of iterator
** 5, so aTree[3] is set to 6. Key 0 is smaller than key 6 (Banana<Durian),
** so the value written into element 1 of the array is 0. As follows:
**
**     aTree[] = { X, 0   0, 6    0, 3, 5, 6 }
**
** In other words, each time we advance to the next sorter element, log2(N)
** key comparison operations are required, where N is the number of segments
** being merged (rounded up to the next power of 2).

** Turn the pExpr expression into an alias for the iCol-th column of the

**
** If the result set column is a simple column reference, then this routine

** routine make a copy of the result set column as the argument to the
** TK_AS operator.  The TK_AS operator causes the expression to be
** evaluated just once and then reused for each alias.
**
** The reason for suppressing the TK_AS term when the expression is a simple
** column reference is so that the column reference will be recognized as
** usable by indices within the WHERE clause processing logic. 
**
** The TK_AS operator is inhibited if zType[0]=='G'.  This means
** that in a GROUP BY clause, the expression is evaluated twice.  Hence:
**
**     SELECT random()%5 AS x, count(*) FROM tab GROUP BY x
**
** Is equivalent to:
**
**     SELECT random()%5 AS x, count(*) FROM tab GROUP BY random()%5
**
** The result of random()%5 in the GROUP BY clause is probably different
** from the result in the result-set.  On the other hand Standard SQL does
** not allow the GROUP BY clause to contain references to result-set columns.
** So this should never come up in well-formed queries.
**
** If the reference is followed by a COLLATE operator, then make sure
** the COLLATE operator is preserved.  For example:
**
**     SELECT a+b, c+d FROM t1 ORDER BY 1 COLLATE nocase;
**
** Should be transformed into:
**
**     SELECT a+b, c+d FROM t1 ORDER BY (a+b) COLLATE nocase;
**
** The nSubquery parameter specifies how many levels of subquery the
** alias is removed from the original expression.  The usually value is
** zero but it might be more if the alias is contained within a subquery
** of the original expression.  The Expr.op2 field of TK_AGG_FUNCTION

/*
** This routine walks an expression tree and resolves references to
** table columns and result-set columns.  At the same time, do error
** checking on function usage and set a flag if any aggregate functions
** are seen.
**
** To resolve table columns references we look for nodes (or subtrees) of the 
** form X.Y.Z or Y.Z or just Z where
**
**      X:   The name of a database.  Ex:  "main" or "temp" or
**           the symbolic name assigned to an ATTACH-ed database.
**
**      Y:   The name of a table in a FROM clause.  Or in a trigger
**           one of the special names "old" or "new".
**
**      Z:   The name of a column in table Y.
**
** The node at the root of the subtree is modified as follows:
**
**    Expr.op        Changed to TK_COLUMN
**    Expr.pTab      Points to the Table object for X.Y
**    Expr.iColumn   The column index in X.Y.  -1 for the rowid.
**    Expr.iTable    The VDBE cursor number for X.Y
**
**
** To resolve result-set references, look for expression nodes of the
** form Z (with no X and Y prefix) where the Z matches the right-hand
** size of an AS clause in the result-set of a SELECT.  The Z expression
** is replaced by a copy of the left-hand side of the result-set expression.
** Table-name and function resolution occurs on the substituted expression
** tree.  For example, in:
**
**      SELECT a+b AS x, c+d AS y FROM t1 ORDER BY x;
**
** The "x" term of the order by is replaced by "a+b" to render:
**
**      SELECT a+b AS x, c+d AS y FROM t1 ORDER BY a+b;
**
** Function calls are checked to make sure that the function is 
** defined and that the correct number of arguments are specified.
** If the function is an aggregate function, then the NC_HasAgg flag is
** set and the opcode is changed from TK_FUNCTION to TK_AGG_FUNCTION.
** If an expression contains aggregate functions then the EP_Agg
** property on the expression is set.
**
** An error message is left in pParse if anything is amiss.  The number
** if errors is returned.

** This function is used by the implementation of the IN (...) operator.
** The pX parameter is the expression on the RHS of the IN operator, which
** might be either a list of expressions or a subquery.
**
** The job of this routine is to find or create a b-tree object that can
** be used either to test for membership in the RHS set or to iterate through
** all members of the RHS set, skipping duplicates.
**
** A cursor is opened on the b-tree object that the RHS of the IN operator
** and pX->iTable is set to the index of that cursor.
**
** The returned value of this function indicates the b-tree type, as follows:
**
**   IN_INDEX_ROWID      - The cursor was opened on a database table.
**   IN_INDEX_INDEX_ASC  - The cursor was opened on an ascending index.
**   IN_INDEX_INDEX_DESC - The cursor was opened on a descending index.
**   IN_INDEX_EPH        - The cursor was opened on a specially created and
**                         populated epheremal table.
**
** An existing b-tree might be used if the RHS expression pX is a simple
** subquery such as:
**
**     SELECT <column> FROM <table>
**
** If the RHS of the IN operator is a list or a more complex subquery, then
** an ephemeral table might need to be generated from the RHS and then
** pX->iTable made to point to the ephermeral table instead of an
** existing table.  
**
** If the prNotFound parameter is 0, then the b-tree will be used to iterate
** through the set members, skipping any duplicates. In this case an
** epheremal table must be used unless the selected <column> is guaranteed
** to be unique - either because it is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY or it
** has a UNIQUE constraint or UNIQUE index.
**
** If the prNotFound parameter is not 0, then the b-tree will be used 
** for fast set membership tests. In this case an epheremal table must 
** be used unless <column> is an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY or an index can 
** be found with <column> as its left-most column.
**
** When the b-tree is being used for membership tests, the calling function
** needs to know whether or not the structure contains an SQL NULL 
** value in order to correctly evaluate expressions like "X IN (Y, Z)".
** If there is any chance that the (...) might contain a NULL value at
** runtime, then a register is allocated and the register number written
** to *prNotFound. If there is no chance that the (...) contains a
** NULL value, then *prNotFound is left unchanged.
**
** If a register is allocated and its location stored in *prNotFound, then
** its initial value is NULL.  If the (...) does not remain constant
** for the duration of the query (i.e. the SELECT within the (...)
** is a correlated subquery) then the value of the allocated register is
** reset to NULL each time the subquery is rerun. This allows the
** caller to use vdbe code equivalent to the following:
**
**   if( register==NULL ){
**     has_null = <test if data structure contains null>
**     register = 1
**   }
**
** in order to avoid running the <test if data structure contains null>
** test more often than is necessary.

** Generate code for scalar subqueries used as a subquery expression, EXISTS,

**
**     (SELECT a FROM b)          -- subquery
**     EXISTS (SELECT a FROM b)   -- EXISTS subquery
**     x IN (4,5,11)              -- IN operator with list on right-hand side
**     x IN (SELECT a FROM b)     -- IN operator with subquery on the right
**
** The pExpr parameter describes the expression that contains the IN
** operator or subquery.
**
** If parameter isRowid is non-zero, then expression pExpr is guaranteed
** to be of the form "<rowid> IN (?, ?, ?)", where <rowid> is a reference
** to some integer key column of a table B-Tree. In this case, use an
** intkey B-Tree to store the set of IN(...) values instead of the usual
** (slower) variable length keys B-Tree.
**
** If rMayHaveNull is non-zero, that means that the operation is an IN
** (not a SELECT or EXISTS) and that the RHS might contains NULLs.
** Furthermore, the IN is in a WHERE clause and that we really want
** to iterate over the RHS of the IN operator in order to quickly locate
** all corresponding LHS elements.  All this routine does is initialize
** the register given by rMayHaveNull to NULL.  Calling routines will take
** care of changing this register value to non-NULL if the RHS is NULL-free.
**
** If rMayHaveNull is zero, that means that the subquery is being used
** for membership testing only.  There is no need to initialize any
** registers to indicate the presence or absence of NULLs on the RHS.
**
** For a SELECT or EXISTS operator, return the register that holds the
** result.  For IN operators or if an error occurs, the return value is 0.

*************************************************************************
** This file contains code associated with the ANALYZE command.
**
** The ANALYZE command gather statistics about the content of tables
** and indices.  These statistics are made available to the query planner
** to help it make better decisions about how to perform queries.
**
** The following system tables are or have been supported:
**
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat1(tbl, idx, stat);
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat2(tbl, idx, sampleno, sample);
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat3(tbl, idx, nEq, nLt, nDLt, sample);
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat4(tbl, idx, nEq, nLt, nDLt, sample);
**
** Additional tables might be added in future releases of SQLite.
** The sqlite_stat2 table is not created or used unless the SQLite version
** is between 3.6.18 and 3.7.8, inclusive, and unless SQLite is compiled
** with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2.  The sqlite_stat2 table is deprecated.
** The sqlite_stat2 table is superseded by sqlite_stat3, which is only
** created and used by SQLite versions 3.7.9 and later and with
** SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3 defined.  The functionality of sqlite_stat3
** is a superset of sqlite_stat2.  The sqlite_stat4 is an enhanced
** version of sqlite_stat3 and is only available when compiled with
** SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4 and in SQLite versions 3.8.1 and later.  It is
** not possible to enable both STAT3 and STAT4 at the same time.  If they
** are both enabled, then STAT4 takes precedence.
**
** For most applications, sqlite_stat1 provides all the statisics required
** for the query planner to make good choices.
**
** Format of sqlite_stat1:
**
** There is normally one row per index, with the index identified by the
** name in the idx column.  The tbl column is the name of the table to
** which the index belongs.  In each such row, the stat column will be
** a string consisting of a list of integers.  The first integer in this
** list is the number of rows in the index.  (This is the same as the
** number of rows in the table, except for partial indices.)  The second
** integer is the average number of rows in the index that have the same
** value in the first column of the index.  The third integer is the average
** number of rows in the index that have the same value for the first two
** columns.  The N-th integer (for N>1) is the average number of rows in 
** the index which have the same value for the first N-1 columns.  For
** a K-column index, there will be K+1 integers in the stat column.  If
** the index is unique, then the last integer will be 1.
**
** The list of integers in the stat column can optionally be followed
** by the keyword "unordered".  The "unordered" keyword, if it is present,
** must be separated from the last integer by a single space.  If the
** "unordered" keyword is present, then the query planner assumes that
** the index is unordered and will not use the index for a range query.
** 
** If the sqlite_stat1.idx column is NULL, then the sqlite_stat1.stat
** column contains a single integer which is the (estimated) number of
** rows in the table identified by sqlite_stat1.tbl.
**
** Format of sqlite_stat2:
**
** The sqlite_stat2 is only created and is only used if SQLite is compiled
** with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2 and if the SQLite version number is between
** 3.6.18 and 3.7.8.  The "stat2" table contains additional information
** about the distribution of keys within an index.  The index is identified by
** the "idx" column and the "tbl" column is the name of the table to which
** the index belongs.  There are usually 10 rows in the sqlite_stat2
** table for each index.
**
** The sqlite_stat2 entries for an index that have sampleno between 0 and 9
** inclusive are samples of the left-most key value in the index taken at
** evenly spaced points along the index.  Let the number of samples be S
** (10 in the standard build) and let C be the number of rows in the index.
** Then the sampled rows are given by:
**
**     rownumber = (i*C*2 + C)/(S*2)
**
** For i between 0 and S-1.  Conceptually, the index space is divided into
** S uniform buckets and the samples are the middle row from each bucket.
**
** The format for sqlite_stat2 is recorded here for legacy reference.  This
** version of SQLite does not support sqlite_stat2.  It neither reads nor
** writes the sqlite_stat2 table.  This version of SQLite only supports
** sqlite_stat3.
**
** Format for sqlite_stat3:
**
** The sqlite_stat3 format is a subset of sqlite_stat4.  Hence, the
** sqlite_stat4 format will be described first.  Further information
** about sqlite_stat3 follows the sqlite_stat4 description.
**
** Format for sqlite_stat4:
**
** As with sqlite_stat2, the sqlite_stat4 table contains histogram data
** to aid the query planner in choosing good indices based on the values
** that indexed columns are compared against in the WHERE clauses of
** queries.
**
** The sqlite_stat4 table contains multiple entries for each index.
** The idx column names the index and the tbl column is the table of the
** index.  If the idx and tbl columns are the same, then the sample is
** of the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.  The sample column is a blob which is the
** binary encoding of a key from the index.  The nEq column is a
** list of integers.  The first integer is the approximate number
** of entries in the index whose left-most column exactly matches
** the left-most column of the sample.  The second integer in nEq
** is the approximate number of entries in the index where the
** first two columns match the first two columns of the sample.
** And so forth.  nLt is another list of integers that show the approximate
** number of entries that are strictly less than the sample.  The first
** integer in nLt contains the number of entries in the index where the
** left-most column is less than the left-most column of the sample.
** The K-th integer in the nLt entry is the number of index entries 
** where the first K columns are less than the first K columns of the
** sample.  The nDLt column is like nLt except that it contains the 
** number of distinct entries in the index that are less than the
** sample.
**
** There can be an arbitrary number of sqlite_stat4 entries per index.
** The ANALYZE command will typically generate sqlite_stat4 tables
** that contain between 10 and 40 samples which are distributed across
** the key space, though not uniformly, and which include samples with
** large nEq values.
**
** Format for sqlite_stat3 redux:
**
** The sqlite_stat3 table is like sqlite_stat4 except that it only
** looks at the left-most column of the index.  The sqlite_stat3.sample
** column contains the actual value of the left-most column instead
** of a blob encoding of the complete index key as is found in
** sqlite_stat4.sample.  The nEq, nLt, and nDLt entries of sqlite_stat3
** all contain just a single integer which is the same as the first
** integer in the equivalent columns in sqlite_stat4.

** various fields of the database.  The first argument to the auth function
** is a copy of the 3rd argument to this routine.  The second argument
** to the auth function is one of these constants:
**
**       SQLITE_CREATE_INDEX
**       SQLITE_CREATE_TABLE
**       SQLITE_CREATE_TEMP_INDEX

** SQLITE_OK is returned, it means that access is allowed.  SQLITE_DENY
** means that the SQL statement will never-run - the sqlite3_exec() call
** will return with an error.  SQLITE_IGNORE means that the SQL statement
** should run but attempts to read the specified column will return NULL
** and attempts to write the column will be ignored.
**
** Setting the auth function to NULL disables this hook.  The default
** setting of the auth function is NULL.

**          identified by the sqlite_master table entry of the table itself.
**     (3)  Set the Index.tnum of the PRIMARY KEY Index object in the
**          schema to the rootpage from the main table.
**     (4)  Set all columns of the PRIMARY KEY schema object to be NOT NULL.
**     (5)  Add all table columns to the PRIMARY KEY Index object
**          so that the PRIMARY KEY is a covering index.  The surplus
**          columns are part of KeyInfo.nXField and are not used for

** Generate code that will assemble an index key and stores it in register
** regOut.  The key with be for index pIdx which is an index on pTab.
** iCur is the index of a cursor open on the pTab table and pointing to
** the entry that needs indexing.  If pTab is a WITHOUT ROWID table, then
** iCur must be the cursor of the PRIMARY KEY index.
**
** Return a register number which is the first in a block of
** registers that holds the elements of the index key.  The
** block of registers has already been deallocated by the time
** this routine returns.
**
** If *piPartIdxLabel is not NULL, fill it in with a label and jump
** to that label if pIdx is a partial index that should be skipped.
** A partial index should be skipped if its WHERE clause evaluates
** to false or null.  If pIdx is not a partial index, *piPartIdxLabel
** will be set to zero which is an empty label that is ignored by
** sqlite3VdbeResolveLabel().
**
** The pPrior and regPrior parameters are used to implement a cache to
** avoid unnecessary register loads.  If pPrior is not NULL, then it is
** a pointer to a different index for which an index key has just been
** computed into register regPrior.  If the current pIdx index is generating
** its key into the same sequence of registers and if pPrior and pIdx share
** a column in common, then the register corresponding to that column already
** holds the correct value and the loading of that register is skipped.
** This optimization is helpful when doing a DELETE or an INTEGRITY_CHECK 
** on a table with multiple indices, and especially with the ROWID or
** PRIMARY KEY columns of the index.

/*
** Deferred and Immediate FKs
** --------------------------
**
** Foreign keys in SQLite come in two flavours: deferred and immediate.
** If an immediate foreign key constraint is violated,
** SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY is returned and the current
** statement transaction rolled back. If a 
** deferred foreign key constraint is violated, no action is taken 
** immediately. However if the application attempts to commit the 
** transaction before fixing the constraint violation, the attempt fails.
**
** Deferred constraints are implemented using a simple counter associated
** with the database handle. The counter is set to zero each time a 
** database transaction is opened. Each time a statement is executed 
** that causes a foreign key violation, the counter is incremented. Each
** time a statement is executed that removes an existing violation from
** the database, the counter is decremented. When the transaction is
** committed, the commit fails if the current value of the counter is
** greater than zero. This scheme has two big drawbacks:
**
**   * When a commit fails due to a deferred foreign key constraint, 
**     there is no way to tell which foreign constraint is not satisfied,
**     or which row it is not satisfied for.
**
**   * If the database contains foreign key violations when the 
**     transaction is opened, this may cause the mechanism to malfunction.
**
** Despite these problems, this approach is adopted as it seems simpler
** than the alternatives.
**
** INSERT operations:
**
**   I.1) For each FK for which the table is the child table, search
**        the parent table for a match. If none is found increment the
**        constraint counter.
**
**   I.2) For each FK for which the table is the parent table, 
**        search the child table for rows that correspond to the new
**        row in the parent table. Decrement the counter for each row
**        found (as the constraint is now satisfied).
**
** DELETE operations:
**
**   D.1) For each FK for which the table is the child table, 
**        search the parent table for a row that corresponds to the 
**        deleted row in the child table. If such a row is not found, 
**        decrement the counter.
**
**   D.2) For each FK for which the table is the parent table, search 
**        the child table for rows that correspond to the deleted row 
**        in the parent table. For each found increment the counter.
**
** UPDATE operations:
**
**   An UPDATE command requires that all 4 steps above are taken, but only
**   for FK constraints for which the affected columns are actually 
**   modified (values must be compared at runtime).
**
** Note that I.1 and D.1 are very similar operations, as are I.2 and D.2.
** This simplifies the implementation a bit.
**
** For the purposes of immediate FK constraints, the OR REPLACE conflict
** resolution is considered to delete rows before the new row is inserted.
** If a delete caused by OR REPLACE violates an FK constraint, an exception
** is thrown, even if the FK constraint would be satisfied after the new 
** row is inserted.
**
** Immediate constraints are usually handled similarly. The only difference 
** is that the counter used is stored as part of each individual statement
** object (struct Vdbe). If, after the statement has run, its immediate
** constraint counter is greater than zero,
** it returns SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY
** and the statement transaction is rolled back. An exception is an INSERT
** statement that inserts a single row only (no triggers). In this case,
** instead of using a counter, an exception is thrown immediately if the
** INSERT violates a foreign key constraint. This is necessary as such
** an INSERT does not open a statement transaction.
**
** TODO: How should dropping a table be handled? How should renaming a 
** table be handled?
**
**
** Query API Notes
** ---------------
**
** Before coding an UPDATE or DELETE row operation, the code-generator
** for those two operations needs to know whether or not the operation
** requires any FK processing and, if so, which columns of the original
** row are required by the FK processing VDBE code (i.e. if FKs were
** implemented using triggers, which of the old.* columns would be 
** accessed). No information is required by the code-generator before
** coding an INSERT operation. The functions used by the UPDATE/DELETE
** generation code to query for this information are:
**
**   sqlite3FkRequired() - Test to see if FK processing is required.
**   sqlite3FkOldmask()  - Query for the set of required old.* columns.
**
**
** Externally accessible module functions
** --------------------------------------
**
**   sqlite3FkCheck()    - Check for foreign key violations.
**   sqlite3FkActions()  - Code triggers for ON UPDATE/ON DELETE actions.
**   sqlite3FkDelete()   - Delete an FKey structure.
*/

/*
** VDBE Calling Convention
** -----------------------
**
** Example:
**
**   For the following INSERT statement:
**
**     CREATE TABLE t1(a, b INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, c);
**     INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 2, 3.1);
**
**   Register (x):        2    (type integer)
**   Register (x+1):      1    (type integer)
**   Register (x+2):      NULL (type NULL)
**   Register (x+3):      3.1  (type real)
*/

/*
** A foreign key constraint requires that the key columns in the parent
** table are collectively subject to a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint.
** Given that pParent is the parent table for foreign key constraint pFKey, 
** search the schema for a unique index on the parent key columns. 
**
** If successful, zero is returned. If the parent key is an INTEGER PRIMARY 
** KEY column, then output variable *ppIdx is set to NULL. Otherwise, *ppIdx 
** is set to point to the unique index. 
** 
** If the parent key consists of a single column (the foreign key constraint
** is not a composite foreign key), output variable *paiCol is set to NULL.
** Otherwise, it is set to point to an allocated array of size N, where
** N is the number of columns in the parent key. The first element of the
** array is the index of the child table column that is mapped by the FK
** constraint to the parent table column stored in the left-most column
** of index *ppIdx. The second element of the array is the index of the
** child table column that corresponds to the second left-most column of
** *ppIdx, and so on.
**
** If the required index cannot be found, either because:
**
**   1) The named parent key columns do not exist, or
**
**   2) The named parent key columns do exist, but are not subject to a
**      UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, or
**
**   3) No parent key columns were provided explicitly as part of the
**      foreign key definition, and the parent table does not have a
**      PRIMARY KEY, or
**
**   4) No parent key columns were provided explicitly as part of the
**      foreign key definition, and the PRIMARY KEY of the parent table 
**      consists of a a different number of columns to the child key in 
**      the child table.
**
** then non-zero is returned, and a "foreign key mismatch" error loaded
** into pParse. If an OOM error occurs, non-zero is returned and the
** pParse->db->mallocFailed flag is set.

** This routine is called to handle SQL of the following forms:

**    insert into TABLE (IDLIST) select
**
** The IDLIST following the table name is always optional.  If omitted,
** then a list of all columns for the table is substituted.  The IDLIST
** appears in the pColumn parameter.  pColumn is NULL if IDLIST is omitted.
**
** The pList parameter holds EXPRLIST in the first form of the INSERT
** statement above, and pSelect is NULL.  For the second form, pList is
** NULL and pSelect is a pointer to the select statement used to generate
** data for the insert.
**
** The code generated follows one of four templates.  For a simple
** insert with data coming from a VALUES clause, the code executes
** once straight down through.  Pseudo-code follows (we call this
** the "1st template"):
**
**         open write cursor to <table> and its indices
**         put VALUES clause expressions into registers
**         write the resulting record into <table>
**         cleanup
**
** The three remaining templates assume the statement is of the form
**
**   INSERT INTO <table> SELECT ...
**
** If the SELECT clause is of the restricted form "SELECT * FROM <table2>" -
** in other words if the SELECT pulls all columns from a single table
** and there is no WHERE or LIMIT or GROUP BY or ORDER BY clauses, and
** if <table2> and <table1> are distinct tables but have identical
** schemas, including all the same indices, then a special optimization
** is invoked that copies raw records from <table2> over to <table1>.
** See the xferOptimization() function for the implementation of this
** template.  This is the 2nd template.
**
**         open a write cursor to <table>
**         open read cursor on <table2>
**         transfer all records in <table2> over to <table>
**         close cursors
**         foreach index on <table>
**           open a write cursor on the <table> index
**           open a read cursor on the corresponding <table2> index
**           transfer all records from the read to the write cursors
**           close cursors
**         end foreach
**
** The 3rd template is for when the second template does not apply
** and the SELECT clause does not read from <table> at any time.
** The generated code follows this template:
**
**         X <- A
**         goto B
**      A: setup for the SELECT
**         loop over the rows in the SELECT
**           load values into registers R..R+n
**           yield X
**         end loop
**         cleanup after the SELECT
**         end-coroutine X
**      B: open write cursor to <table> and its indices
**      C: yield X, at EOF goto D
**         insert the select result into <table> from R..R+n
**         goto C
**      D: cleanup
**
** The 4th template is used if the insert statement takes its
** values from a SELECT but the data is being inserted into a table
** that is also read as part of the SELECT.  In the third form,
** we have to use a intermediate table to store the results of
** the select.  The template is like this:
**
**         X <- A
**         goto B
**      A: setup for the SELECT
**         loop over the tables in the SELECT
**           load value into register R..R+n
**           yield X
**         end loop
**         cleanup after the SELECT
**         end co-routine R
**      B: open temp table
**      L: yield X, at EOF goto M
**         insert row from R..R+n into temp table
**         goto L
**      M: open write cursor to <table> and its indices
**         rewind temp table
**      C: loop over rows of intermediate table
**           transfer values form intermediate table into <table>

** Generate code to do constraint checks prior to an INSERT or an UPDATE
** on table pTab.
**
** The regNewData parameter is the first register in a range that contains
** the data to be inserted or the data after the update.  There will be
** pTab->nCol+1 registers in this range.  The first register (the one
** that regNewData points to) will contain the new rowid, or NULL in the
** case of a WITHOUT ROWID table.  The second register in the range will
** contain the content of the first table column.  The third register will
** contain the content of the second table column.  And so forth.
**
** The regOldData parameter is similar to regNewData except that it contains
** the data prior to an UPDATE rather than afterwards.  regOldData is zero
** for an INSERT.  This routine can distinguish between UPDATE and INSERT by
** checking regOldData for zero.
**
** For an UPDATE, the pkChng boolean is true if the true primary key (the
** rowid for a normal table or the PRIMARY KEY for a WITHOUT ROWID table)
** might be modified by the UPDATE.  If pkChng is false, then the key of
** the iDataCur content table is guaranteed to be unchanged by the UPDATE.
**
** For an INSERT, the pkChng boolean indicates whether or not the rowid
** was explicitly specified as part of the INSERT statement.  If pkChng
** is zero, it means that the either rowid is computed automatically or
** that the table is a WITHOUT ROWID table and has no rowid.  On an INSERT,
** pkChng will only be true if the INSERT statement provides an integer
** value for either the rowid column or its INTEGER PRIMARY KEY alias.
**
** The code generated by this routine will store new index entries into
** registers identified by aRegIdx[].  No index entry is created for
** indices where aRegIdx[i]==0.  The order of indices in aRegIdx[] is
** the same as the order of indices on the linked list of indices
** at pTab->pIndex.
**
** The caller must have already opened writeable cursors on the main
** table and all applicable indices (that is to say, all indices for which
** aRegIdx[] is not zero).  iDataCur is the cursor for the main table when
** inserting or updating a rowid table, or the cursor for the PRIMARY KEY
** index when operating on a WITHOUT ROWID table.  iIdxCur is the cursor
** for the first index in the pTab->pIndex list.  Cursors for other indices
** are at iIdxCur+N for the N-th element of the pTab->pIndex list.
**
** This routine also generates code to check constraints.  NOT NULL,
** CHECK, and UNIQUE constraints are all checked.  If a constraint fails,
** then the appropriate action is performed.  There are five possible
** actions: ROLLBACK, ABORT, FAIL, REPLACE, and IGNORE.
**
**  Constraint type  Action       What Happens
**  ---------------  ----------   ----------------------------------------
**  any              ROLLBACK     The current transaction is rolled back and
**                                sqlite3_step() returns immediately with a
**                                return code of SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.
**
**  any              ABORT        Back out changes from the current command
**                                only (do not do a complete rollback) then
**                                cause sqlite3_step() to return immediately
**                                with SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.
**
**  any              FAIL         Sqlite3_step() returns immediately with a
**                                return code of SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.  The
**                                transaction is not rolled back and any
**                                changes to prior rows are retained.
**
**  any              IGNORE       The attempt in insert or update the current
**                                row is skipped, without throwing an error.
**                                Processing continues with the next row.
**                                (There is an immediate jump to ignoreDest.)
**
**  NOT NULL         REPLACE      The NULL value is replace by the default
**                                value for that column.  If the default value
**                                is NULL, the action is the same as ABORT.
**
**  UNIQUE           REPLACE      The other row that conflicts with the row
**                                being inserted is removed.
**
**  CHECK            REPLACE      Illegal.  The results in an exception.
**
** Which action to take is determined by the overrideError parameter.
** Or if overrideError==OE_Default, then the pParse->onError parameter
** is used.  Or if pParse->onError==OE_Default then the onError value
** for the constraint is used.
